            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat thou art here preſented with the enſuing Sermons, is from the ſame deſire and deſign that acted the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Author in the preaching of them, <hi>viz.</hi> of recommending the Truth and Grace of God to whomſoever they ſhall come. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been with approbation and acceptance enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in thoſe publick Auditories where they were delivered; It is to be hoped that being now expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to publick view from the Preſs, they will no leſs both profit and delight. The matter and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of them will eaſily induce any who knew the Author to believe them to be his. But that none may think themſelves impoſed upon, they may be aſſured that they have all been carefully and faithfully tranſcribed out of his own Notes which he left behind him. And though ſome of them may be more peculiar in their uſe to ſome ſort of perſons according to the Auditories whereto they were preached; yet even in them there is handled matter of univerſal Chriſtian know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:56446:3"/>
            <p> That therefore the great end of all Preaching, Writing and Reading (namely Knowing, Loving, and Living to God in Chriſt) may hereby be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, God Himſelf of His mercy grant, who <hi>teacheth</hi> his <hi>to profit:</hi> And ſo neither ſhall the Publiſher, to whom the Author's memory ought to be ever precious, nor the Reader have cauſe to repent them.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Nay learn by teaching, and get by giving, for that's one way better to ſee and know Chriſt and our ſelves, by ſhewing and holding him out to others. The Maſter while he teacheth his Scholar improves himſelf. It's ſo in the nature of the thing; but over and beſides by reaſon of Gods Bleſſing. As the Nurſes Breaſts grow bigger and fuller by giving ſuck, and we uſe to feed them well that our Children might fare the better.</p>
               <p>And therefore.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In private converſe let all Chriſtians be imparting ſomething of their knowledge of Chriſt, that they may receive it back again with advantage. Here <gap reason="foreign">

At ſuch meetings when every one brings his Symbol, all are feaſted, and he that invites and entertains others is himſelf a gainer. It's but putting a little water into the Pump that brings up more.

               <p>And therefore although I am very far from either countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Lay-Preachers of our days, who pretending moſt to the knowledge of Chriſt, are ſuch <hi>Miniſters of the ſpirit</hi> that they have all <hi>good letters</hi> in abomination.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Lay aſide all vain and unlawful ſtudies which do not only take up the time, which ſhould be better ſpent in the ſtudying of Chriſt, but do ſo either intangle or debaſe the Soul, that they keep out the light of the <hi>ſun of Righteouſneſs.</hi> Such are</p>
               <p n="1">1. All <hi>black Arts,</hi> which the <hi>Children of light</hi> have no inſight into. The <hi>ſun of Righteouſneſs</hi> its beams, when they break out, <hi>burn</hi> ſuch <hi>books.</hi> It's no right courſe by digging in Hell to find the way to Heaven, or to have acquaintance with Chriſt by having (as you are wont to call it) a <hi>Familiar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:56446:20" rendition="simple:additions"/> 2. All <hi>Arts of Love,</hi> all profane and laſcivious ſpeculations, and ſtudying of ſuch Books which are incentives of Luſt, and by which the Student becomes <hi>ingenioſiſſimè nequam;</hi> a ſnare which youth is frequently taken with; and it were well if ſome that were more gtown up were wholly freed from. But this is one kind of having <hi>fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs:</hi> and which leads <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 11.</note> off from acquaintance with Chriſt. For the Books which for the preſent we read are wont to leave a tincture and impreſſion upon the ſpirit of the Reader, eſpecially if his judgment be weak, as ours in younger years are not very ſtrong. And of this make this trial, whether when you have been greedy in reading ſuch Books you have thereby any great mind to read the Bible. I am ſure that when you have been ſeriouſly reading it, you will have as little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in reading them, as <hi>Paul</hi> had in <hi>the thorn in his fleſh,</hi> when he had before been <hi>caught up to Paradiſe,</hi> as <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ama ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam ſcripturarum, &amp; vitia carnis non amabis.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Let this be the firſt Caveat in our learning to know Chriſt, that we lay aſide theſe and ſuch like ſtudies that either in their own nature eſtrange us from him, or at leaſt as we handle the matter hinder us in our ſearch after him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let the ſecond Caveat be this, that as to this end, we muſt lay aſide all unlawful ſtudies, ſo we muſt take heed that we do not overdo in our ſtudies that are lawful. Not that I would have you ſtudy them leſs: but Chriſt more. Nor them ſo much as Chriſt leſs.</p>
               <p>And this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Either for <hi>time,</hi> in ſpending it ſo wholly on them that there's none left for thoſe duties in which we ſhould more immediately acquaint our ſelves with Chriſt. Many a cloſe ſtudent who hath ſtinted himſelf to ſtudy ſo many hours a day, hath (it may be) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to put into the account one half hour to pray and read the Scripture, which is ſuch a <hi>leaning to our own underſtanding, that we acknowledge not God.

               <p>Either they never come to attain that knowledge they are ſo eager upon: <hi>they had no knowledge that called not upon God. Pſal.</hi> 14. 4. Such hardeſt Students have not always proved the beſt Scholars, but have only ſtudied themſelves blind, and put out their Eyes by their own Candle light:</p>
               <p>Or, if often they prove Scholars, it's as often that of all others they are furtheſt off from being Chriſts Diſciples. It hath been no news in the World both in preſent and former times to find great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Scholars greateſt Atheiſts. The wiſeſt of the World <hi>by their wiſdom knew not God.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. The Creature terminated their ſight which ſhould have been a tranſparent glaſs, in and through which they ſhould have ſeen God, and ſo by poring on it they loſt him, even there, where he was to be found, when our other ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſo wholly take up our time, that our addreſſes to Chriſt are either wholly excluded or curtailed, he who is thereby ſo much undervalued cannot but be very much offended. It's a ſad ſtory that you read of <hi>Origen,</hi> who in his <hi>Lamentation</hi> confeſſeth that

                  <p>O therefore, that our Eyes were enlightned to ſee his beauty, and our hearts raiſed up to a more anſwerable valuation of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable worth.</p>

                  <p>But more lively and vigorous actings of faith in this kind are moſt uſeful; for it hath an eye ſeriouſly and buſily viewing the vanity of the World, and the excellency of Chriſt, and ſo eaſily diſcerns the difference.</p>

               <p>Now what a long Bede-roul, or large Charter of privileges and Prerogatives, and Titles of Honour, doth the Apoſtle here produce to check the proud boaſting of the <hi>falſe Apoſtles,</hi> and to ſhew that he did not undervalue them out of envy of them that vaunted themſelves of them becauſe he had them not, as many oftentimes contemn thoſe things in others, <hi>quae ipſi neſciunt vel</hi>

               <p>We have here a large Field, in which in theſe many forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned particulars we have ſcattered as many ſtalks with full ears, which for our uſe and benefit we may either gather up in ſome few maniples, or bind up in one ſheaf and bundle thus.</p>

               <p>This one contains the general ſum of that whole verſe, and thoſe three the chief heads, which all the forementioned particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars may be referred to.</p>
               <p>But before I particularly conſider them, to prevent miſtake, let me premiſe, that <hi>Paul</hi> did not here play the Leveller, and jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Kings and Queens, and Peaſants all together, as in a Cheſs-bag. God who <hi>is not the God of confuſion,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 33. would have us <hi>obſerve order:</hi> and when he makes a difference, would have us take notice of it.

               <p>So for the firſt, of <hi>Antiquity; Ancient things,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4. 22. <hi>ancient people, Iſa</hi> 44. 7. <hi>Nations, Jer.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>Landmarks, Prov.</hi> 22. 28. <hi>Rivers, Judg.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>Paths, Jer.</hi> 18. 15. <hi>Mountains, Deut.</hi> 33. 15. are in Scripture ſpoken of with honour; as <hi>anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> and <hi>honourable</hi> are joined together, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 15. And truly if <hi>ancient Monuments</hi> be <hi>venerable,</hi> then to be <hi>the Sons of ancient Kings</hi> in Scripture-Phraſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19. 11. may well go for a

               </p>

               <p>In theſe and the like particulars very many and great are the Bleſſings that come to Children from godly Parents, were it their Covenant only if duly improved: and it is the great ſin of ſome Children that it is not improved at all, and of the beſt, that it is not more than uſually it is.

                  <hi>ſeaſonable</hi> now to be urged, when Ordinances are by ſo many ſo much vilified, when the <hi>Socinian</hi> ſo much blancheth both the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56446:46"/> 
                  <hi>Miniſtery</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and ſo many <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> think themſelves <hi>above Ordinances.</hi> Are they now at leaſt to be lower'd by us when ſo unworthily trampled upon by others? Is not this on the one hand to <hi>help the ungodly?</hi> which was reproved in <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 2.</note> and on the other, to <hi>add affliction to the afflicted;</hi> which God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth himſelf ſo highly diſpleaſed with, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 26, 27.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, God forbid that I ſhould undervalue them at any time, <note place="margin">Sol.</note> eſpecially when others ſo much ſleight them: But I take it to be no diſparagement to the beſt perſons or things to be placed in their own rank, or for beſt Ordinances to be ſet under Chriſt. And for the <hi>time,</hi> although ſome now pull them down too <hi>low,</hi> yet others wind them up too <hi>high;</hi> as the <hi>Socinian</hi> doctrinally takes too much from them, ſo the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> (whom at preſent we are as much in danger of) in his <hi>opus operatum</hi> gives too much to them: Nor doth the <hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi> more <hi>vilifie</hi> them, than the <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant carnal,</hi> both <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and <hi>Papiſt, reſt in them,</hi> and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enjoyment of them. All I ſhall here add, is, that this Truth (by Providence) lieth in my way, and therefore I may not well balk it, eſpecially ſeeing the Text gives me occaſion to treat as well of their poſitive worth in themſelves and to us, as of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value in compariſon with Chriſt; for it being the Apoſtles inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to advance the worth and eſteem of Chriſt by preferring him before other things, it was congruous to that deſign to compare him with, and prefer him before ſuch as were of ſome, nay of greateſt worth. For elſe, for him to have ſaid that Chriſt was better than ſome of the meaneſt things, had been a very mean and low commendation, indeed a diſparagement rather than a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation; for that which is but a little bigger than the leaſt, is almoſt next to nothing. They are therefore great things and greatly eſteemed, which Chriſt is here preferred to, and amongſt the reſt before the beſt Ordinances; and therefore according to the true ſenſe and ſeries of the Apoſtles arguing here, if we would make it to be rational, and honourable for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I have two things incumbent on me.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſhew the true worth of Ordinances, and what anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able eſteem we ſhould have of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How much Chriſt exceeds them in true value, and ſhould ſo much in our valuation, as that however otherwiſe we ought to value them, yet ſo as to <hi>account them loſs and dung</hi> in point of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, <hi>in compare with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. The firſt, becauſe they are here made but as a foil, the better
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56446:46"/> to ſet off the tranſcending beauty of Chriſt; I ſhall the leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on.</p>
               <p>However Ordinances are here ſuppoſed to be in themſelves of great worth, and therefore by us to be highly valued, and that deſervedly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe they are Gods Inſtitutions, and therefore called <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi> as ordained by him: and therefore alſo it was that when our Saviour had inſtituted them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>go and teach and baptize,</hi> he addeth, <hi>v.</hi> 20. that he would, and that <hi>to the end of the world,</hi> have all <hi>obſerved that he had commanded, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe he had commanded them.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56446:60"/> And it would be a ſtrange means of reconciling us to God, which makes us at odds one with another.</p>
               <p>But for the better diſpatch of this point, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew.</p>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>1. For the firſt I lay down theſe particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it <hi>is</hi> not always a <hi>Sect</hi> in this bad ſenſe, which the World often <hi>calls</hi> ſo: for <hi>Paul</hi> could find a great difference which he intimated, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 14. when he ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and thereby ſhews, that there may be a <hi>way</hi> (even the way of Faith, Grace, and Chriſtianity) which the Jews then <hi>called,</hi> and many now <hi>call Hereſie:</hi> but they only call it ſo in their corrupt <hi>Nomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clature,</hi> which is far from being ſo in truth and reality. And ſo <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> by <hi>Papiſts</hi> are called <hi>Sectaries;</hi> and ſome amongſt us are bold to jumble <hi>Lutherans, Calviniſts, Arminians,</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> together, and to make <hi>Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of them all: and ſo indeed they may be as they may handle the matter, as we ſhall ſee by and by. But yet if the truth be with any of them, it's not a <hi>Sect,</hi> nor they <hi>Sectaries</hi> for maintaining it. The Reformed Churches are no Schiſmaticks for breaking off from Communion with Papiſts in their <hi>Idolatries,</hi> nor thoſe that are <hi>ſound in the faith,</hi> and holy in practice, for declining or decrying other mens errors or impieties. It's neither Sedition in the State to diſown factions, nor Schiſm in the Church to keep the whole Cloth from others patches. We muſt adhere to Chriſt and his Truth and Grace, though we be called <hi>Sectaries</hi> for it: and <hi>Paul after the way that they called Hereſie, worſhipped the God of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</hi> and he was never the worſe man for their calling him ſo, but the better for his doing ſo. They are guilty of the <hi>Schiſm</hi> which hold and do that, in which others according to the word in Conſcience cannot join with them, and they that <hi>depart from the truth</hi> are they that in truth <hi>make parties.</hi> Not they that <hi>take part with Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>manage it according to Chriſt.</hi> I ſay both, becauſe</p>
               <p n="2">2. On the contrary we may indeed make a <hi>Faction</hi> of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and our way a by way, not tending <hi>to Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>from him,</hi> and that two ways:</p>
               <p n="1">1. When the ground, aim, and very materials of our Sect and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56446:61"/> Religion is nothing of Chriſt, but indeed contrary to him. Whither we may refer the various <hi>Sects</hi> of the Heathen Philoſophers as well the more moral <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and the more refined contemplative <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonicks,</hi> and the more rational <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> as the more brutiſh <hi>Epicureans.</hi> Hither alſo the oppoſite Factions of <hi>Hillel</hi> and <hi>Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mai</hi> among the Jews, their three more famous Sects in our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's time, or the ſeven which <note n="*" place="margin">In Dial. cum Tryph.</note>

Theſe and ſuch like are properly <hi>Sects,</hi> whilſt of their own heads they divide themſelves, and that oft-times to great enmities and alienations from others and from God himſelf, whilſt they <hi>ſet their threſholds,</hi> (as the Prophet ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) <note place="margin">

               <p n="2">2. Nay it may be a Sect, when the ground-work is good, and the part we take to in the main right; but all ſpoiled by our ill managing of it.</p>
               <p>Thus 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf is perverſly made the maſter of a <hi>Sect;</hi> nor were they more Sectaries that ſaid, <hi>I am of Paul,</hi> and, <hi>I of Apollo,</hi> and, <hi>I of Cephas,</hi> than they that added, <hi>and I am of Chriſt,</hi> which (as too many now do) <hi>pretending Chriſt,</hi> and yet <hi>rejecting</hi> the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> parted <hi>Chriſt</hi> from his <hi>Miniſters (with whom</hi> he promiſed <hi>to be to the end of the world)</hi> and ſo made a <hi>Party.</hi>

               <p>And this further in the third place is advanced, when theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and following of parties are managed with <hi>ſtrife</hi> and <hi>conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> hatred, rage, calumnies, and evil ſpeakings and doings againſt oppoſite parties, as it was in that place of the <hi>Corinths;</hi> when it was <hi>for</hi> one, it was <hi>againſt</hi> another.

            <p>In the handling of which particular according to the true ſenſe and intent of the Apoſtle in this place, I ſhall endeavour to make out theſe three things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That this <hi>zeal</hi> ſimply in it ſelf is very valuable.</item>

               <item> 2. So that we naturally are very apt to applaud our ſelves and to reſt in it.</item>

               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, That zeal in Religion in the General is very valuable. So <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the Apoſtle here rates it, when he puts it into the Inventory of his chiefeſt <hi>Phariſaical</hi> excellencies, and elſewhere he poſitively makes this appraiſement of it, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Zeal,</hi> and zeal <hi>for Religion</hi> are two very great words, and very conſiderable, as <hi>frigidum in Religione pectus</hi> (as <hi>Gualther in Apologiâ</hi> ſpeaks) is <hi>nauſeous</hi> and <hi>abominable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For zeal in its own nature, it's not either a ſingle, or weak faint affection. No. It is a compound of more, partaking both <note place="margin">

            <p>So juſtly provoking and therefore ſo highly diſpleaſing is the want of <hi>zeal</hi> to God, which inferreth the preſence of it the more highly grateful to him—and this the more, in that it is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful

            <p> But after he was once converted, humbled, and <hi>caught up into the third heaven,</hi> he there learnt another leſſon, ſo that we find him here in the Text of another mind.

            <p>The third thing propounded and principally intended, That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it is not even a Religious zeal that (as to our acceptance with God) we ſhould pleaſe our ſelves with, ſo as to reſt in, but we muſt <hi>renounce all confidence in it, that we may win Chriſt:</hi> and that upon ſeveral accounts.

But would a <hi>wiſe man</hi> lay his <hi>whole weight</hi> on a <hi>ruſh?</hi> or ſhould the <hi>furnace be heated ſeven times hotter to burn a ſtraw?</hi> or dare we think God to be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as we are, to be taken with ſuch trifles?

            <p n="3">3. Our zeal may be againſt ſin, and yet not rightly pitched, when it's only againſt other mens ſins, and not our own. So <hi>Judah</hi> was all <hi>fire and tow</hi> againſt <hi>Tamar</hi> for playing the Harlot <hi>(bring her forth and let her be burnt, Gen.</hi> 38. 24.) till by the <hi>ſtaff, ſignet and bracelet</hi> he came to know that <hi>it was himſelf</hi> by <hi>whom ſhe was with Child,</hi> and then we hear no more of it, the fire was quenched preſently.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56446:78"/> which makes us ſo angry (and as we think zealous) in other mens ſins, is becauſe it diſpleaſeth rather us than <hi>God,</hi> and rather thwarts our touchy humour or it may be outward deſign or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt than Gods holy Nature and will. But this is a diſtempered heat and no true zeal; <hi>Paſſion</hi> without <hi>Compaſſion</hi> which our Saviours zeal was ever happily tempered with, as we read, <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 5. when he <hi>looked upon</hi> the <hi>Jewes</hi> with moſt <hi>anger,</hi> that he was withal <hi>grieved</hi> and that <hi>for the hardneſs of their hearts.</hi> And thus in theſe and the like reſpects our even Religious zeal may be far from commending us to God, if firſt thus miſplaced, and miſ-pitched upon wrong objects.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if ill grounded for the inward cauſe and principle. To which let me add, and as ill guided in the undue manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it; if not principled and managed with knowledge, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and love.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If principled and managed without knowledge. For this ſharp knife need be in a wary hand and wiſely handled. So our Apoſtle tells us, the <hi>Jews</hi> had <gap reason="foreign">

No, rather knowledge without zeal doth little good; but zeal without knowledge is in danger to do a great deal of hurt. The one is like a Ship that hath a good Card and Pilot, but without Sail and ſo ſtirs not, the other hath a large ſail, but wants Compaſs and Pilot to ſteer it aright, and ſo ſoon runs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rock; and here oftentimes the more <hi>blind</hi> the more <hi>bold,</hi> and the <hi>leſs light</hi> the <hi>more heat:</hi> more ignorant men are uſually the more zealous.

            <p>Thus are we deluded and gulled with vain ſhadows and fancies, and as ſometimes all <hi>Egypt</hi> was <hi>ſcattered over with Iſraelites ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of ſtraws, Exod.</hi> 5. 12. ſo the whole World is now ſpread over with ſuch as are no better imployed, with Boys running amain after Bees or painted Butter-flies, that have either a wing to fly away from him, or a ſting if caught to wound him.

To ſuch eyes Chriſt had <hi>no beauty in him to be deſired, Iſa.</hi> 53. 2. As the hungry Plowman muſt have ſomething that hath <hi>cut</hi> in it, you pine him with dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſo here theſe ſpiritual dainties that we partake of by <hi>feeding on Chriſt by faith, living on God by hope, looking up to heaven in prayer,</hi> eſpecially if joined with <hi>repentance</hi> for thoſe things which a carnal heart rejoiceth in, and <hi>reformation</hi> and <hi>mortification,</hi> and <hi>denial of thoſe luſts,</hi> which all the comfort of his life is wrapt up in, and if <hi>the Kingdom of God</hi> conſiſt in <hi>righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> theſe are (as to <hi>Gallio)</hi> but <hi>words and</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But are they therefore the leſs <hi>ſubſtantial?</hi> was Chriſt's, and ſhall our Bodies after their Reſurrection be leſs <hi>real</hi> Bodies, becauſe more <hi>ſpiritual?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 44. Are Angels and our own Souls

God is moſt bleſſed without all theſe. And our Saviour ſpeaks of <hi>drinking of the fruit of the Vine new in his Father's Kingdom,</hi> and he told <note place="margin">

               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:56446:98"/> 2. A Second particular as to our underſtandings which ſuits not with this <hi>ſubſtance</hi> in the Text, nor that anſwerable <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantialneſs</hi> that ſhould be in every true <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> is when the whole or main ſubſtance of all our Religion is in taking up and maintaining ſome <hi>Notions and Opinions,</hi> and it may be ſome <hi>new lights</hi> and <hi>high ſpeculations,</hi> concerning which we are not (as the Scepticks were, in the former particular) at an indifferency, but <hi>preſs them with utmoſt intention,</hi> as if in them were the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, kernel, the very heart and ſubſtance of all godlineſs, as in truth it is the whole of many of thoſe who now moſt pretend to godlineſs, who by being of ſuch or ſuch a Sect, opinion or perſuaſion do meaſure their own and others Saintſhips, like them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 4. who <hi>gave heed to fables and endleſs genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, doubting about queſtions, and oppoſitions of ſcience falſly ſo called,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 4, 20. which is far enough from that <hi>laying up a good ſolid ſubſtantial foundation,</hi> which the Apoſtle exhorted to in the verſe foregoing. Were the bare knowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of moſt ſolid truths ſufficient, <hi>Satan</hi> may go for a <hi>Saint.</hi> But if the whimſies, and airy or fiery fancies of weak or hot heads may go for ſound and ſolid Religion, it would be a very thin empty frothy thing, not this <hi>ſubſtance</hi> which the Text ſpeaks of. The <hi>Aſtronomers Phaenomena</hi> in heaven may be of ſome good uſe, but ſuch in our brains will never light us thither. Let therefore ſuch Spaniſh <hi>Alumbradoes</hi> or Engliſh <hi>Illuminates</hi> pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <note place="margin">

On the contrary let it be the care of every one that would prove a ſubſtantial Chriſtian, by all good means to attain to a ſolid judgment of ſaving truth, and not reſt there neither, but becauſe <hi>Theologia</hi> is not <hi>ſcientia ſpeculativa</hi> but <hi>practica,</hi> and becauſe in Scripture-uſe <hi>verba ſenſûs affectum &amp; effectum connotant,</hi> words of knowledge and ſenſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply affection, and <hi>Divinity is an art of living,</hi> and not only of <hi>bare knowing,</hi> as many of us as would be ſolid Divines and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Chriſtians, (as the lamenting Churches <hi>eye affected her heart, Lament.</hi> 3. 54. ſo) let our knowledge effectually preſs on to earneſt affection, and real action, which leadeth on to the other two Heads before mentioned.</p>
            <p>2. And as concerning our hearts and affections, two things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> alſo either fall ſhort of or come croſs to that ſubſtantialneſs which is to be expected from them, whom Chriſt cauſeth to <hi>inherit ſubſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt is a weak faint liſtleſneſs and deadneſs in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goings
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56446:98"/> of our ſouls to Chriſt, an heartleſs velleity, a wiſhing and a woulding, rather than any true and hearty willing: <hi>Balaam</hi>'s <hi>wiſhes,</hi>

So when our deſires and affections to Chriſt do ſo freeze in our boſoms, they come ſhort of this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> this <hi>Eſt</hi> in the Text; they are, and they are not. When we ſay and profeſs that Chriſt is ſuch ſolid food, <hi>his fleſh,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <hi>meat indeed,</hi> and we bring ſuch flaſhy deſires and ſuch faint ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites to him, what do we but make men believe that either he is not found food, or at leaſt that we have but ſick ſtomachs? He not <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> or we not <hi>ſubſtantial Chriſtians?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But Secondly, There is another diſtemper in this kind, which wanteth not for ſtrength, but yet in <hi>ſubſtance.</hi> The wind no ſolid ſubſtantial body, yet may be very violent and impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: ſuch a <hi>flatulency</hi> there is in many mens ſpirits, which makes a ſhew of a great deal of real zeal and ſtrength of affection for God and Chriſt, and yet is nothing but an empty ſwelling tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, an impetuous violence to proſecute our own deſires, opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and wayes, and to bear down whatſoever rather diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us than what offendeth God. Such was <hi>Jehu's</hi> zeal, and <note place="margin">2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 14.</note> the <hi>Ruler of the Synagogue his indignation,</hi> and the more to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the unſubſtantialneſs of it, it's uſually not about the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>the weightier things of the law,</hi> and ſuch as concern the ſubſtance and <hi>power of godlineſs;</hi> but about circumſtances and externals, or other leſs and lighter matters, as it was with the <hi>Phariſees</hi> about their <hi>Mint</hi> and <hi>Aniſe</hi> and <hi>Phylacteries,</hi> and ſo now is with the Papiſts about their Ceremonies and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and with many amongſt us about ſome niceties in Church government and outward forms and other curious Punctilioes, which are at a great diſtance from the heart and ſoul and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Religion. Here we have heat enough and too much, a feveriſh heat but not kindly and natural, fire, but ſuch as proves wild-fire, making a blaze in lighter ſtraw, but ſuch as putteth all into a combuſtion. Oh beware of ſuch a dangerous miſtake, as to take the violence of an unmortified paſſion for the power and ſubſtance of <hi>ſaving grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore if ever we would attain to ſolid and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial evidence of it, our contrary care and effectual indeavour muſt be</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:56446:99"/> 1. Contrary to that coolneſs and indifferency of our affections to Chriſt to riſe up to more ſtrong and earneſt outgoings of our Souls after him, ſuch as the Scripture expreſſeth by <hi>hungrings</hi> and <hi>thirſtings,</hi> and <hi>longings, breathings, breakings, pantings,</hi> and <hi>faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> after God; not a <hi>faintneſs</hi> of <hi>indifferency,</hi> but a fainting upon our being ſpent in eagereſt purſuits of what we cannot fully overtake, that it cometh not to <hi>I am</hi> and <hi>I am not,</hi> but as Chriſt named himſelf <hi>I am,</hi> ſo with truth and reality I can eccho back <note place="margin">

               </gap>nt of my Soul, I am for thee, and ſo indeclinably and earneſtly move towards thee, that I ſhall not be quiet till I reſt in thee. I do not meaſure <hi>ſubſtance</hi> by <hi>quantity,</hi> nor judge of truth of grace by the degree; though ſome now will needs wholly place it in it. There is the true eſſence and ſubſtance of a man in a weak Child, and weak deſires after Chriſt may be true and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, if this weakneſs be occaſioned from other hinderances, and not from an indifferency, but ſtill giving Chriſt the Soveraignty. But yet ſuch weakneſs ſhould not be reſted in, but over-grown, and more <hi>ſtrong and earneſt workings</hi> of the heart to be grown up to, if we would have more <hi>real and ſubſtantial,</hi> at leaſt more <hi>ſenſible evidences</hi> of the life and <hi>power of godlineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor muſt we ſatisfie our ſelves with this. There was <hi>ſtrength</hi> enough and in ſome reſpects too much in that impetuous <hi>flatulency</hi> of ſome men's ſpirits, which was the ſecond miſcarriage before noted. But therefore contrary to it our care muſt be, if we would have evidence of true, ſolid, ſubſtantial godlineſs, that this ſtrength of paſſion do not only bluſter towards others, but that it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth real and ſubſtantial effects in our own hearts, and that we find and feel it ſo doing, for as they are wont to ſay, that <hi>Tactus eſt fundamentum vitae ſenſitivae,</hi> ſo real felt inward effects in the Soul, are ſureſt evidences of a true ſpiritual life alſo; ſuch as were before-mentioned in the doctrinal part of this point as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial and real effects and operations of Chriſt in us, are to this purpoſe to be really felt and expreſſed by us.</p>

            <p>But this leads me to a more particular view of this <hi>fulneſs of Chriſt:</hi> which may be conſidered either, 1. in regard of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or, 2. of his offices.</p>
            <p>1. For his Perſon, if we conſider it either <hi>quoad gratiam uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis,</hi> or <hi>gratiam habitualem,</hi> either the Divine Nature aſſuming the Humane into the ſame perſonal ſubſiſtence, or that Grace, which thereupon is from that <hi>Divine Nature</hi> communicated to the <hi>Humane</hi> for its compleat accompliſhment, there can be no leſs in one <hi>Chriſt</hi> than All fulneſs and perfection, in himſelf and for all ſuch as are united to him.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

               <hi>the ſubſiſtence of the Godhead, John</hi> 1. 14. <hi>The word was made fleſh,</hi> and then <hi>we beheld his glory as the only begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther full of Grace and Truth;</hi> that it's <hi>God</hi> who laid down his <hi>own bloud</hi> as a price of redemption for us, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. and that every way makes a ſupply to us. And then, how <hi>full</hi> muſt that needs be? He would have us <hi>hungry:</hi> But he is too greedy, whom an <hi>Alſufficient Chriſt</hi> cannot <hi>ſatisfy.</hi> That want is more than infinite, which an infinite God cannot make up. <hi>Do not I fill heaven and earth? ſaith the Lord, Jer.</hi> 23. 24.

            <p n="2">2.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquitaries</hi> would have it) but that the <hi>ſpirit was given to him ſo above meaſure, John</hi> 3. 34. that he became ſuch a Fountain of Grace, as was not only full in himſelf, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing to the full ſupply of all believers. And this Grace in him (though but a created quality and therefore <hi>not properly infinite,</hi> yet) ſo as not limited to any kind, or degree, and in that ſenſe <hi>in a manner infinite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this <hi>grace</hi> was <hi>full</hi> not only in reference to <hi>Him,</hi> and <hi>His ſtate and condition:</hi> for in that ſenſe <hi>Mary</hi> is ſaid to have been <hi>full of grace, Luke</hi> 1. 28. and <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, full of the Holy Ghoſt, Act.</hi> 7. 55. 11. 24. namely as they were filled ſo far as was requiſite to that condition and ſervice, to which God called them.</p>
            <p>But Chriſt who is ſaid to be <hi>full of the Holy Ghoſt, Luke</hi> 4. 1. and <hi>full of grace and truth, John</hi> 1. 14. was full alſo in <hi>reference to the Grace</hi> it ſelf, in that it was in him in the greateſt exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion both for <hi>Kind</hi> and <hi>Degree,</hi> which the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> and the <hi>perfecteſt</hi> Saint fell ſhort of, as <hi>not neceſſary to their place and employment, as it was to Chriſts;</hi> who as he was in himſelf, God-Man, ſo he was to be <hi>Head</hi> to all <hi>Believers,</hi> and <hi>Fountain</hi> and <hi>common principle of all Grace in them all;</hi> which neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it to be a <hi>compleat over-flowing fulneſs.</hi> And this leads me off from this fulneſs of Chriſt in reference to his Perſon, to</p>

            <p n="1">1. Becauſe indeed <hi>all things.</hi> So the Apoſtle ſtyles him, <hi>All in All, Col.</hi> 3. 11.

            <p n="2">2. More particularly; <hi>fully able to ſupply all our wants,</hi> and that in <hi>the greateſt extremities of them;</hi> as <hi>Bethſaida's Pool</hi> cured every <hi>patient,</hi>

               </gap>, <hi>of whatever diſeaſe he had, John</hi> 5. 4. ſo truly in Chriſt there is a ſalve for every ſore. He is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>All</hi> and <hi>in All,</hi> both perſons and wants. And ours are very great and many. Our Souls and ſelves without Chriſt are a very <hi>Tohu</hi> and <hi>Bohu, wholly empty and void,</hi> a vaſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptineſs; and every Creature though in its kind never ſo uſeful and helpful, though never ſo full, as we think, of comfort is but empty; And emptineſs put to <hi>emptineſs</hi> will not make up any <hi>fulneſs.</hi> At beſt is but <hi>bonum particulare,</hi> helps but in part. Our meat <hi>ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth our hunger,</hi> but doth not <hi>cover our nakedneſs:</hi> and our <hi>gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cloath us,</hi> but do not <hi>feed us.</hi> But <hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Bonum <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſale,</hi> is All, doth All.

            <p n="3">3. So <hi>full</hi> as to ſatisfie all our deſires, and that in their utmoſt capacity. You heard of a <hi>mouth</hi> promiſed to be <hi>filled</hi> when <hi>wide open, Pſal.</hi> 81. 10. And this is more than the former. Your or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary plain ſaying is, that <hi>you may better fill a wantons belly than his eye.</hi> Truly ſuch wantons often are many fooliſh men. The Pſalmiſt ſpeaks of their <hi>bellies being filled, Pſal.</hi> 17. 14. when yet the Preacher ſaith, <hi>the eye is not ſatisfied, Eccleſ.</hi> 1. 8. So naturally capacious are the rational Souls of men, and ſo ſinfully and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably greedy are their deſires and luſts, that nothing in the World can fill them. But it's well that God and Chriſt can. As God, <hi>He ſatisfieth the deſire of every living thing, Pſal.</hi> 145. 16. and as Mediatour he ſaith, <hi>Drink, yea drink abundantly, O beloved, Cant.</hi> 5. 1. Spare not my coſt but enlarge your appetite. Man's deſires may be large: but God's Goodneſs and Bounty in Chriſt is infinite, able to ſupply all our wants in their extremity, and all the deſires of our Souls in their utmoſt capacity. But of this I ſpake ſomething in the firſt Point, and therefore here forbear.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Yet let me add this in the fourth place, as an <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Some of his <hi>Servants</hi> have been ſo filled with ſpiritual joys, that they have deſired him to hold his hand, as not being able to receive or hold, or bear any more.</p>
            <p>Yea ſo full and exuberant is this <hi>fountain of life,</hi> that it runs over in many common bounties even to <hi>Strangers</hi> and <hi>Enemies;</hi> ſo that not only the <hi>Children are fed,</hi> but even the Dogs gather up the <hi>crumbs that fall from this full table.</hi> O full-handed Father!

                  <hi>Ruth.</hi> 2. 4, 18.</note> more abundantly in Chriſt's. Taſts, Pledges, earneſt-pennies here
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56446:110"/> are very ſatisfying. What then will the full meal, and payment, and portion in Heaven be? If he ſo ſatisfie us here, he will there for certain <hi>fill our treaſures.</hi> They ſo ſatisfie, that they would not have any thing elſe: but only are unſatisfied, that they have no more of them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Add hereto, if you pleaſe, in the fifth place that this filling over-flowing <hi>fulneſs of Chriſt</hi> appears yet further, in that he can thus compleatly <hi>fill us by himſelf</hi> alone when there is ſo little (it may be nothing) elſe to beſtead us. A little ſpring, if it have many rivolets falling into it as it runs along, may at laſt ſwell into a great ſtream, and all Rivers meeting may make a full Sea and vaſt Ocean: but it's a <hi>full fountain</hi> indeed that of it ſelf alone fills all the Cocks, and ſets all the Mills a going. No great matter for a confluence of all outward comforts to fill a man, and that rather with pride and ſelf, than any ſolid ſatisfaction. But</p>
            <p>Either when we have but little elſe, to have fully enough whilſt <note place="margin">When they ſhewed him two Swords, he ſaid it was enough. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 38.</note> we have the more of Chriſt; when <hi>ſo many thouſand are fed to the full, and ſo much to ſpare,</hi> when the Proviſion was but <hi>five barly loaves</hi> (that was but ſparing and courſe) <hi>and two ſmall fiſhes,</hi> (but <hi>two</hi> and they <hi>little ones too)</hi> made the miracle the greater, and tells us that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the <hi>entertainer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or when there is nothing elſe, and yet <hi>nothing wanting,</hi> when <hi>Chriſt is not.

As it's the <hi>Air</hi> which is not ſeen that fills up that vaſt ſpace betwixt Heaven and Earth: ſo it's nothing elſe but an hidden, unſeen, unknown, unconceiveable <hi>Fulneſs of Chriſt</hi> that fills ſuch Souls with Grace, Peace, and Joy, when all elſe is nothing, or nothing but vacuity and <hi>vanity,</hi> and that the Prophet ſaith is <hi>leſs</hi> and worſe <hi>than nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word <hi>Chriſt</hi> here in the Text when ſpeaking of <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> ſaith it emphatically and excluſively, <hi>I will fill their Treaſures,</hi> I and none, nothing but I.

            <p>Which therefore on the contrary calls upon us to reſt fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with nothing that falls ſhort of Chriſt, that we be ſure that it's he that fills our treaſures.

            <p>And therefore ſo much more for the moſt delightful outward contentments. Poor broken empty ciſterns indeed they are, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we have Chriſt with them.

He is <hi>Husband, Father, Friend, Bread, Light, Life,</hi> &amp;c. to ſhew that the ſatisfying fulneſs of all theſe is in and from him, and that without him if he be not in and with all thoſe, they are but empty.

            </p>
            <p>2. And doth this Text aſſure us that he is both able and willing to do it? It doth then ſuggeſt further matter of <hi>Complaint</hi> and <hi>Duty.</hi> For is Chriſt in himſelf ſo <hi>full,</hi> and ſo able and willing ſo abundantly to ſupply us, as to <hi>fill</hi> even our <hi>Treaſures,</hi> then how is it that we are ſo <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>empty?</hi> that as <hi>poſitively,</hi> we are full of other matters, ſo <hi>privatively,</hi> ſo empty of Chriſt? <hi>O curvae in terras animae, &amp; coeleſtium inanes!</hi> What!

            <p>I ſhall not inſiſt on thoſe who either careleſly or wilfully do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together neglect or refuſe all ſaving participations of Chriſt's ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

Nor is it to ſtrike down ſuch poor Chriſtians as are already ſinking by reaſon of inward faintneſs. I acknowledge that in the <hi>new-born babe</hi> through weakneſs of nature this pulſe may be weak, and in the grown Chriſtian through accidental corruptions and temptations there may be obſtructions and interruptions; but then the man is the more ſick for it, and <hi>nature</hi> thus oppreſſed (if it be <hi>Divine)</hi> ſtruggles and groans the more under it; when the man of God cannot do <hi>the good that he would,</hi> he cryeth out of himſelf as a wretched miſerable man for it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18, 24. though the <hi>root of the matter</hi> be in <hi>him,</hi> as it was in <hi>Job,</hi> yet ſometimes it may be under-ground, and as ſeed ſown under a great weight of earth that keeps it under, but it works and works and at laſt peeps out, and then ſprouts and ſprings apace, ſuch an inward principle there is in <hi>nature,</hi> and ſuch alſo in the ſoul that is <hi>made partaker of</hi> the <hi>divine nature</hi> in its outgoings to that which grace hath made connatural to it.</p>

            <p>Eſpecially that even Heathens ſhould herein exceed us, that they ſhould ſo honourably ſpeak of that God whom we ſo blaſpheme; that they ſhould expreſs more of God by the twilight of nature, than we in the ſun-ſhine of the Goſpel; that <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſhould ſo hardly forbear to pray to <hi>Socrates</hi> as a Saint, whilſt many who are named Chriſtians may (without breach of charity) be called <hi>Atheiſts;</hi> that any of <hi>us</hi> ſhould have upon us ſuch black marks of the Devil, when on many of them we may diſcover (though ruder, yet) very lovely characters and lineaments (by the help only of their natural Divinity) of the <hi>Divine nature,</hi> which we who have better means in all reaſon ſhould be more poſſeſſed of.</p>

            <p>1. To God the Father, who as he is <hi>Fons Deitatis,</hi> and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates <note place="margin">Means.</note> 
               <hi>that Divine nature</hi> to the Son and the ſpirit, ſo he is <hi>Fons Gratiae,</hi> and through the Son by the Spirit imparts this <hi>Divine nature</hi> to all his children. It was his breath that <hi>breathed</hi> into <hi>Adam</hi> at firſt that <hi>ſoul</hi> in which eſpecially was his <hi>image,</hi> and it muſt be his breathing ſtill that muſt breath into our hearts that divine grace in which conſiſts that his image renewed and this Divine nature. God <hi>our Creatour</hi> is the Author of this <hi>new Creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here the means of it on our parts is by humble and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt prayer to breath after him for it, as the dying man gaſpeth for breath that is going away, or rather as the dry earth gapeth for heavens rain and influence which it wanteth, and ſo in this <hi>ſyſtole</hi> and <hi>diaſtole</hi> upon the out-breathing of our ſouls and deſires
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:56446:132"/> followeth in God's way the breathing in of this Divine breath of life, the <hi>quickning ſpirit</hi> by which we are made ſpiritual <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſouls.</hi> In this caſe it was ſaid of <hi>Saul, Behold he prayeth, Acts</hi> 9. 11.</p>
            <p>For, although it be true, that the <hi>prayers of the wicked,</hi> whilſt they purpoſe to go on in ſin, are an <hi>abomination to the Lord;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And as true that the prayer of any in an eſtate of corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it cometh from ſuch is ſo defiled, that in regard of any worth in it inſtead of meriting an anſwer it juſtly deſerveth a denial. Whereupon our Antinomians and others do wickedly forbid ſuch to pray:</p>
            <p>Yet in ſuch ſinners that lie under the burden of ſin and miſery and are looking out for help and mercy; to look up to God in prayer for it,</p>
            <p>A it is the homage which is due from the creature to its Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour, and ſo to be tendred to him;</p>
            <p>So it is the way ordained by God, in and by which the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in want and miſery may come to receive mercy. Which therefore God commands, and that to a <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and that upon only a <hi>Perhaps</hi> to receive mercy, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 22. <hi>pray God</hi> if <hi>perhaps</hi> the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee.</p>
            <p>And which therefore in obedience to ſuch a command to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, is (both in God's intention and ordination on his part, and as to the happy ſucceſs and event on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ur parts) the direct ſutable and ſucceſsful means of our obtaining as all other mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, ſo of this which is one of the chief of all, of being <hi>made partakers of the Divine nature,</hi> and that upon a double ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As in a way of moral cauſality it prevaileth with God, and through his indulgence procureth of him the grant of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable gift of the <hi>new creature,</hi> this <hi>divine nature,</hi> as <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> in this caſe by his prayer prevailed with God for his return both from his ſin and captivity together, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 12, 13. and ſo ſtill, the <hi>child</hi> is born <hi>crying:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. So alſo in a kind of phyſical efficiency (as I may call it) In the very act of praying we ſo nearly converſe with God that by looking up to him we are made like him: as the ſtung <hi>Iſraelite</hi> by <hi>looking</hi> to the <hi>Brazen Serpent</hi> was healed, and <hi>Moſes</hi> by near approaches to God and communing with him on <hi>the Mount</hi> had irradiations of his glory reflected on him; ſo in near and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent addreſſes to God by prayer there is much communication
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:56446:132"/> of God by ſuch cloſe communion with him. Papiſts are wont to picture their Saints praying with a <hi>Glory</hi> on their head; but true Saints that are much with God have much of God and his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous grace on their hearts, and none more than thoſe that come into his preſence oftneſt, get neareſt and keep cloſeſt. Our Saviour when he was <hi>praying in the Mount</hi> was transfigured, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 29. Nor are we ever more transformed into the image of God and Chriſt, than when we have got up our hearts higheſt and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in that duty. Be much therefore with God our Father in prayer for this mercy.</p>
            <p>2. Make neareſt applications to Chriſt the Son and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour by faith in his promiſes, for</p>
            <p>By the <hi>promiſes</hi> (we read in the Text) we come to be <hi>partakers</hi> of the <hi>divine nature:</hi> which when ſealed to us, there is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs of Chriſt ſtamped on us. And Chriſt is wrapt up in thoſe promiſes, who as in his Incarnation was made partaker of our <hi>nature,</hi> ſo by him and his grace alone we are made <hi>partakers</hi> of his.</p>
            <p>And faith is the eye and hand which ſeeth and taketh hold of Chriſt in the promiſes, and ſo by <hi>beholding</hi> him in that <hi>glaſs,</hi> as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectus fit idem cum objecto, we</hi> come to <hi>be changed</hi> (as we heard) into the ſame <hi>image from glory to glory.</hi> There is an image of the thing ſeen in the eye that looks on it, and we by faith wiſtly eying of Chriſt have his image ſo imprinted on us, that we prove no longer like our ſelves. As the wiſe men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. when they had ſeen him, <hi>turn'd back another way, v.</hi> 12. So they that by him are <hi>made wiſe to Salvation,</hi> never ſavingly ſaw him, but went away with <hi>another heart,</hi> not their former ſelves, but chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into another, that is to ſay, this <hi>divine nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe promiſes and Chriſt in them apply we our ſelves; for it's from his <hi>fulneſs</hi> (as before we heard) that we muſt only <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive grace for grace,</hi> grace in us anſwerable to the grace in him.</p>
            <p>And content we not our ſelves with moral and Philoſophical conſiderations as able to work ſuch a change. <hi>Gehazi</hi> may lay <note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 31.</note> the ſtaff on the child's face, and no life come: the water will not riſe higher than from whence it deſcended. Nature in its higheſt elevations will not be able of it ſelf to riſe up to ſaving grace, nor will any moral ſpeculations or qualifications lift us up to a <hi>divine nature.</hi> Chriſt is the fountain-head. He came down from heaven to work it, and therefore to him in heaven by faith
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:56446:133"/> muſt we riſe up, if ever we would have it wrought in us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And to the ſpirit of Chriſt, for this <hi>changing into the ſame</hi> image (as we alſo heard) is <hi>by the ſpirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. It was this ſpirit that <hi>breathed</hi> the image of God into us in <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7.</note> our firſt creation, and it muſt be the ſame ſpirit that muſt breath into us this new life, the <hi>finger</hi> of this <hi>ſpirit,</hi> that only can draw upon us theſe fair and lovely characters and lineaments of this Divine image; the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>regeneration</hi> that muſt <hi>beget</hi> us to this <hi>new nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore here again reſt not in higheſt either natural or moral conſiderations; they are but airy, and their birth will be anſwerable, prove abortions, or like that of the Spaniſh mares which (they ſay) conceive by breathing in the South-wind, but their Foals (they ſay too) preſently languiſh and die, and ſo (at laſt to be ſure) will all ſuch births of our own beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially take heed of <hi>grieving</hi> and <hi>reſiſting the ſpirit</hi> in theſe his Divine workings. If the child would be born, if it cannot further its own birth, let it not hinder it by working backward; becauſe it is <hi>God that worketh in us both to will and to do,</hi> let us <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12, 13.</note> not marr his work, but in and by his ſtrength <hi>work out our own ſalvation,</hi> by not being flints to God, but as wax to yield to, and to receive his Divine impreſſions. Thus applying our ſelves to God this happy work may and will be wrought, and rather than fail, God can make even <hi>afflictions</hi> a means to effect it, that what are in themſelves <gap reason="foreign">

(and that is no leſs than to be <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the divine nature)</hi> and whilſt we ſo <hi>ſuffer, Peter</hi> ſaith, the <hi>ſpirit of glory, yea and of God reſteth upon us;</hi> and ſo moſt happy <hi>participations</hi> of the <hi>divine</hi> glory and <hi>nature</hi> are communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to us. Never was more of God ſeen in any, than in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs by the light of the fires they were conſumed in.</p>
            <p>Thus upon theſe conſiderations and in the uſe of theſe and the like means, our firſt duty is to endeavour to come to be <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of this divine nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. And then ſecondly <hi>walk worthy of it,</hi> and anſwerable to it, that we <hi>ſhew forth the vertues of God,</hi> as our Apoſtle exhorted <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 9. of the former Epiſtle, that in our ſpirits and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages more of God may appear than of our ſelves; as in red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hot

Otherwiſe whilſt the <note place="margin">As every thing in the firſt Creation <hi>brought forth fruit according to its kind, Gen.</hi> 1. 11, 12. ſo in this new Creation, let us in our kind.

               <hi>Sons of God</hi> walk like other <hi>children of men,</hi> expreſs as much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and as little grace, whilſt (according to the Text) we ſay and preach that they are <hi>partakers of the divine nature,</hi> men will be ready to think that the <hi>Citizens of Zion,</hi> and of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Commonwealth are much a-kin if not the ſame; but Ideas and fancies, and like as the Painters pictures of Angels, and the Papiſts of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> in which they intend not to make them like, but only brave and beautiful: ſo we ſay rather what they ſhould be than what they are, but (it may be) the quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as <hi>Polydor Virgil</hi> obſerves that their Popes had uſually names given them which were quite contrary to their temper and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: but although Art may paint, yet Nature is real, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou ſayeſt that thou art <hi>partaker of this divine Nature; loquere ut videam,</hi> ſay, and then do and be what may really and ſubſtantially prove and manifeſt it, otherwiſe an Ape will be an Ape though with a childs coat put upon it, and (as it is in the ſtory) will ſhew as much when almonds are caſt before it. <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram expellas furcâ licèt, &amp;c.</hi> Nature may be diſguiſed and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for a while and for ends, and upon deſign thou maiſt mask and keep it in, but it will out; ſo will corrupt nature, and ſo will the Divine too, which we ſhould labour what we can to exert and manifeſt, and that ſo evidently and fully that both our ſelves and others may be convinced that what we are or do can proceed from no lower a principle. By wallowing in ſenſual luſts and pleaſures we take part with the <hi>beaſt:</hi> to be proud, envious, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous and malicious, is to partake of <hi>the Devil;</hi> that is <hi>bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh,</hi> this <hi>deviliſh;</hi> to be kind and courteous is indeed <hi>humanity,</hi> but if there be no more, it falleth exceeding ſhort of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> and our walking up to it and <hi>worthy</hi> of it.</p>

               </gap> here uſed properly ſignifieth to govern a City or Common-wealth, and thence cometh to ſignify a man's go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning himſelf, whether in publick or private. And though I confeſs the word <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 6. ſo I conceive one part of this <hi>Converſation</hi> conſiſts in that outward grave ſober and amiable behaviour, which becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all, but eſpecially a Chriſtian, which the Apoſtle brings the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to Epiſt. 1. Chap. 11. 13. <hi>Judg in your ſelves,</hi> is <hi>it comely,</hi> &amp;c. which goeth through all both Vertues and Graces, and giveth a ſplendor to all: nor yet only that which Ethicks help the Moraliſt to, but a Chriſtian decency made up of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and amiableneſs; the one ariſing from a ſerious and ſetled courſe of Godlineſs, and the other from inward peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, there being a Calm within, and therefore there muſt needs be a Serenity without. And truly why ſhould the Goſpel only make Men untoward? or why ſhould profeſſors of it be eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially blamed for bad natures and harſh carriages? Seeing <hi>Plato's</hi> Divinity was, that <hi>Pulchrum &amp; Bonum</hi> were the ſame, and the ſame word ſignifieth both; why ſhould they be ſevered in us that profeſs more Divine Philoſophy? Not that I doubted that many ſuch imputations are falſe of many Men; accounting it unmannerlineſs and frowardneſs, when the Godly will <hi>not run with them into the ſame exceſs of Riot;</hi> Nor that I condemned all, whoſe natural diſpoſitions are more rough, and ſo their carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in this reſpect leſs amiable. No, I know the Lord had uſe of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s more retired and auſtere, as well as of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's more amiable and pleaſing behaviour; Nor did he that firſt preached in that regard at firſt blemiſh the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>And yet I muſt needs ſay that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> prayed well, when they deſired of God, <hi>ut pulchra cum bonis iis tribueret;</hi> and it would be well if Chriſtians now would joyn both. For if it be that, by which an Animal exceeds that which is Inanimate, that together with <hi>bonum</hi> it can <hi>appetere pulchrum,</hi> which the Inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate skills not of; let it never be that, in which a Chriſtian ſhall be inferiour to another, that whatever care he hath for the <hi>lawfulneſs,</hi> yet he ſhould have none for the <hi>decency</hi> of his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. If <hi>Ariſtotle's happy Man</hi> is always attended upon with his <hi>Pulchritudo</hi> and <hi>Gratia,</hi> It's pity that <hi>our bleſſed Man</hi> ſhould want either. But this is only the <hi>Chain about the Spouſes Neck;</hi> the <hi>Fringe</hi> of that Garment that makes a Chriſtians Profeſſion and behaviour comly &amp; glorious. And indeed were this all the Grace that could commend him or the Goſpel, we might well ſay of it, as ſome of them did of theirs, that it were <hi>eburneum detrimentum;</hi> the painting only of (perhaps) a foul Face, not a <hi>vital fulgor,</hi> by which they uſe to define true Beauty.</p>
            <pb n="378" facs="tcp:56446:139"/>
            <p> 2. And therefore, as they uſe to ſay, that <hi>Gratia eſt vitale, quid &amp; ſpirituale;</hi> ſo (in the ſecond place) there is a more <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>live</hi> Beauty, which addeth luſtre to a Chriſtian's both Life and Profeſſion. I mean true ſanctifying <hi>Grace,</hi> which makes both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, &amp; whatſoever proceedeth from him in this ſence truly <hi>Gracious.</hi> And that this becometh the Goſpel of Grace, we may be aſſured it's not the Pope's triple-Crown, nor the Cardinal's Scarlet, nor the Papiſt's exceſſive pomp in their ſervice, no nor their ſpeaking and writing for the honour of it, that commends it to the World ſo much as the faithful expreſſing the Life and Power of it in our Lives and Carriage; for, before moſt of theſe w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ere heard of, what was the reaſon that a few mean Fiſhermen and others of the like condition could ever have been able to lead the whole World Captive, even <hi>compel all to come in,</hi> and to <hi>ſubject</hi> themſelves to the <hi>profeſsed obedience of the Goſpel?</hi> Was it not, becauſe that Chriſt and his Spirit (as he had promiſed them) was with them? not only in their Preaching, but alſo in their Carriage and Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, ſo that they who otherwiſe were contemned as baſe, and accuſed as <hi>deceivers,</hi> could yet <hi>commend themſelves to Mens Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> though not to their luſts; that they could appeal both to <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2.</note> God and Man in this caſe; <hi>Ye are Witneſſes, and God alſo, how holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and juſtly and unblameably we have behaved our ſelves among you that believe,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 2. 10. So that though in <hi>other</hi> reſpects men looked at them as <hi>the filth and off-ſcouring of the World,</hi> yet in <hi>this</hi> they were <hi>the Glory of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 23. In a word, ſo many Graces are as ſo many Jewels that <hi>adorn the Goſpel,</hi> and make the Spouſe of Chriſt <hi>glorious.</hi> So there is a <hi>Beauty of Holineſs,</hi> Pſal. 29. 2. yea, a Majeſty, and that's more. Thus by <hi>Faith the Elders received a good Report,</hi> Heb. 11. 2. And by true ſaving Wiſdome, <hi>Solomon</hi> aſſureth us, we ſhall receive <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, as the Septuagint, <hi>a Crown of Glory,</hi> as ours read it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 9. Every particular Grace is part of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Beauty. But as they uſe to ſay <hi>Pulchritudo non eſt partis, ſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſiti;</hi> ſo the perfection of Beauty ariſeth from <hi>all Graces,</hi> and a <hi>Perfetion in all.</hi> Which, though we cannot here attain to, yet if we ſtrive after it what we can, we ſhall ſurely procure either love or reverence. If the <hi>Amiableneſs</hi> of Holineſs will not <hi>allure;</hi> the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of it will <hi>daunt</hi> the proudeſt Scorner; and why may it not allure the moſt obſtinate, ſeeing it wins Grace in God's Eyes, and therefore may juſtly challenge it in ours? And here now I might open ſuch a Cabinet of precious Jewels, I
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:56446:139"/> mean ſo many ſeveral Graces, as were they put on, and worn by us, would ſo beautify every part of a Chriſtian, that you ſhould not ſee a <hi>Mordecai</hi> riding on <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> Horſe with his Imperial Robes and Crown, or another <hi>Joſeph</hi> with <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Ring on his Hand, and a <hi>Chain of Gold about his Neck,</hi> with the People bowing the Knee, and crying <hi>Abrek;</hi> but a Man of God, <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the Divine Nature,</hi> and well-nigh already glorified, and ſo both himſelf and his profeſſion glorious in the Eyes of God, and Angels. But all theſe curious pieces I have not now leiſure to view; many of them you may in the following Chapters of this Epiſtle. I ſhall content my ſelf with two; which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle unfolds in the latter part of this Verſe, in which he uſeth a Metaphor taken from an Army, in which two things are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the comelineſs and ſafeguard of it; Unity amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and Valour in beating back the adverſary. Proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to which, two things he telleth us will become us in our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p>

            <p>In the firſt place therefore for Love and Unity. How well it ſutes with the Goſpel we may conceive, in that it's called the <hi>Goſpel of Peace,</hi> Epheſ. 6. 15. And therefore agreeth not with our Heart-burnings and Diſſenſions: Brings us glad tidings of our reconciliation with God, and therefore, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> to his Brethren, bids us <hi>take heed we fall not out by the way.</hi> Thus we ſee, it fits well; and would it not be as <hi>comely</hi> as <hi>fitting?</hi> Yes, ſurely. And therefore our Saviour makes one part of his Spou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Beauty, that <hi>her Teeth are like a Flock of Sheep, whereof every one beareth Twins,</hi> as well to expreſs <hi>Love</hi> as <hi>Fruitfulneſs.</hi> And was it not this true-hearted Love, in <hi>having all things common,</hi> in <hi>continuing</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

            <p>2.

Which how anſwerable it is likewiſe to the Goſpel, this only were ſufficient to manifeſt, in that it ſhews what Chriſt endured for us, and therefore may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call on us to indure ſomething for him; and truly if it bring to us <hi>the ſure mercies of David,</hi> we ſhould not be anſwerable to it, if we ſhould prove Flinchers.

               </gap>, <hi>good News,</hi> which we will willingly dye for.

Yea this Glory reflects upon our ſelves likewiſe. So <hi>Peter</hi> aſſures us, that if <hi>we be reproached for the Name of Chriſt, a Spirit of Glory remains upon us,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 14. yea, though we dye for it, yet <hi>Stephens Face will even then ſhine as an Angel's:</hi> So that however ſome indeed, like our nice Dames that would <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>cannot endure Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,</hi> Galat. 6. 12. would not have their Heads cut off in Chriſt's Cauſe, for ſpoiling their Beards, would profeſs the Goſpel, but it muſt be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as thinking Blood and Duſt would ſpoil their effeminate Beauty; yet, believe it, a noble Chriſtian-Souldier is moſt glorious (as the Scripture ſaith of his Saviour, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 1.) <hi>in his Clothes died red,</hi> in his <hi>own and Enemies Blood.</hi> Such reſplendent Stars ſhine brighteſt in ſuch Froſty Winter-Nights. <hi>There be three things,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, which go well, yea there are four which are comely in going</hi> (and that comelineſs for kind, is that which we now ſpeak of) <hi>a Lion, which is ſtrongeſt amongst Beaſts, and turneth not away for any; a Grey-Hound, an Hee-Goat alſo, and a King, againſt whom there is no riſing up,</hi> Prov. 30. 29, 30, 31. I may add one more to thoſe four; and yet add nothing to Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> a reſolved and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Chriſtian, which indeed in this kind exceeds them all. For if a valiant Knight bravely mounted be one of the three moſt glorious ſights in the World, how glorious a ſpectacle will it be to ſee <hi>the Man of God</hi> armed with that Heavenly Panoply, riding in triumph, <hi>more than conquering,</hi> trampling under foot both frowns and favours of either flattering or perſecuting World, and all the Enemies of his Salvation ſo gloriouſly, as that Death, which takes away his Life, addeth to his Glory! Thus thoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Heroes, thoſe Chriſtian-Worthies, I mean thoſe bleſſed Martyrs, lie now in honour, not only <hi>with Swords under their Heads,</hi> which was the Heathen Worthies honour, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 32. 27. but, as they ſay at the Head of <hi>Mahomets</hi> Tomb there is ſuch a Carbuncle that lightens all the Room (though otherwiſe dark) where it is; ſo truly this Crown of Martyrdom, is ſo beſet with ſuch ſparkling Rubies, that ſtill they <hi>ſhine like Stars in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament;</hi>
               <pb n="382" facs="tcp:56446:141"/> their conſtancy lightens their Graces, and the red dye of their Blood was the beſt Vermilion to adorn their Tombs: <hi>the Blood</hi> of them long ſince <hi>dead</hi> yet <hi>ſpeaketh,</hi> as condemning the ungrateful World, who ſo uſed them; ſo to the Eternal Renown both of them and the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>And thus we have ſeen the way how we may <hi>walk worthy of the Goſpel.</hi> If now we enquire after Arguments to perſwade us to endeavour after it, the Text affords us three. The firſt in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, becauſe our Life is a <hi>Converſation.</hi> And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe it's the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> And thirdly, the Goſpel <hi>of Chriſt,</hi> which we muſt labour thus to <hi>adorn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, our life is a <hi>Converſation,</hi> we live amongſt others, and they either <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad:</hi> and in regard of both, we have need, what we can, to be careful.</p>
            <p>As, firſt, we ſhould conſider, that we live in the <hi>Boſome of the Church</hi> amongſt the faithful, are Citizens of the <hi>City of God,</hi> the <hi>Heavenly Jeruſalem;</hi> and therefore it ſtands us in hand that <hi>ut Coelorum municipes nos geramus</hi> (as ſome read the twentieth Verſe of the third Chapter of this Epiſtle) ſo as may be for the honour of our ſelves and Country.

<pb n="383" facs="tcp:56446:141" rendition="simple:additions"/> times, and the like or worſe. If the kindred of Chriſt will ſay <hi>He is mad,</hi> the Phariſees will be animated to ſay <hi>he hath a Devil,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Cartwright.</note> Mark 3. 21, 22. And therefore we have good cauſe to be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Some <hi>Michals</hi> there will be, that will deride <hi>David,</hi> when he behaveth himſelf moſt ſeemly; but will be ſure to lay on load when they find him tripping. It's with a Chriſtian, as with a Man in the Sun-ſhine; which way ſoever he turneth himſelf, he will have a black ſhadow either go before him, or follow him; as <hi>Tertullian</hi> complained in his time, were he a Sober Wiſe Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he was converted to be a Chriſtian, then he turned Fool, and his formèr worth added to his preſent baſeneſs: but if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-time he had been laſcivious and vicious, no better Argument againſt the Chriſtians, that they all were but a company of ſuch like perſons; ſo that if they could not <hi>find</hi> a fault, yet malice would <hi>make</hi> one. And then, how <hi>circumſpectly</hi> had we need to converſe, that, whereas <hi>this way is every where ſpoken againſt,</hi> our lives may ſpeak for us, when neither we nor others can; and that whereas we may be ſure that there will ever be ſome that will <hi>ſpeak all manner of evil of us,</hi> our carriage may ſhew that it's <hi>falſly,</hi> and for <hi>Chriſt's</hi> ſake rather than our own, and ſo either win ſuch as <hi>ſpeak againſt us as evil doers</hi> (1 Pet. 2. 12.) or at leaſt not harden them in their evil courſes, but put <hi>to ſilence the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of fooliſh Men, (v.</hi> 15. of that Chapter,) yea and <hi>make ſuch aſhamed, that falſly accuſe our good Converſation in Chriſt</hi> (in the 16th. verſe of the following.)</p>
            <p>A ſecond Argument to perſwade us is, That it is <hi>the Goſpel</hi> that we ſhould thus adorn; which truly may challenge ſo much at our hands: for if we look at it in it ſelf, it's <hi>the Glorious Goſpel of our bleſſed God,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 11. yea <hi>Glory; exceeding Glory</hi> in the Abſtract, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 10. Pitty therefore that it ſhould be ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our foul Converſation, which ſhould be <hi>kept without ſpot, unrebukable,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts Timothy, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 14. Or if we conſider what it is to us, it will require no leſs at our hands; for it is no other than the King of Heaven's Pardon, ſent to us Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Wretches, that brings glad tidings to us of Freedom and Salvation. And how unfitting then would it be for us to take it and trample it under foot, or any ways ſlight and abuſe it. And yet no better do wicked Men deal with it, who, as they are ſaid (in this ſence) <hi>to do violence to the Law,</hi> Ezek. 22. 26. So in a manner by their foul lives they <hi>put</hi> both Chriſt and his Goſpel to <hi>an open ſhame.</hi> Well: but ſure ſo good News deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth

            </p>
            <p>3. But if all this yet will not, yet, ſeeing, as the Apoſtle adds, it's <hi>the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> let <hi>him</hi> at leaſt prevail with us to give due reſpect to him in the Goſpel: for him we acknowledge to be our King. And would not our bad lives make ſtrangers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe his Laws and Government? He is our glorious <hi>Head,</hi> and would not our deformed behaviours make his myſtical Body like ſome Hippocentaure or Monſter, as the Fathers uſe to urge this againſt their ſemi-Chriſtians? In a word, we profeſs our ſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſo that though we have riches, and honours, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch outward dignities, yet we will do Chriſt ſo much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as to be named (from none of theſe, but) only from him <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And doth it not then ſtand us in hand to take heed, leſt we only in truth get the honour by having ſuch a glorious Name called upon us, and Chriſt rather the diſhonour by having his Name put upon them that are altogether unworthy? as though our Bleſſed Saviour had not endured ſhame enough for us already, that we need now again caſt more upon him, and ſo in a manner <hi>again Crucify the Lord of Glory?</hi> No: Beloved, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured ſhame enough in that ſhameful Death, and therefore we

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The Name of a Chriſtian only was their accuſation, <hi>quia nominis eſt praelium:</hi> but for other matters they were proceeded againſt <hi>praeſumptis, non probatis criminibus,</hi> as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> ſpeaks: And I would to God it were no more now, that in theſe happier days, when through God's infinite Mercy we need not be aſhamed of the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, we were not now a ſhame to it by our bad behaviours. I confeſs Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in thoſe former times were thought badly enough of. <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anum omnium ſcelerum reum,</hi> &amp;c. others thought ſo, and it was well they did but think and ſuſpect what they could not prove. Now Turks and Infidels think we are looſe and licentious, and it were well they did but think ſo. Profane Wretches ſay that many profeſſors of the ways of Grace are Hypocrites, and it were well they did but ſay ſo. They ſay, the beſt of us anſwer not our Profeſſion; and it were very well if it were their ſaying on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that we could anſwer all their accuſations, as <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>Tertullus</hi> his ſlanders, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 13. <hi>Neither can they prove the things, whereof they now accuſe me.</hi> Nay, rather are there not many that inſtead of <hi>living as it becometh the Goſpel,</hi> (as the Prophet
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:56446:143"/> ſpeaketh of the Jews) even <hi>ſeparate themſelves to that ſhame,</hi> Hoſ. 9. 10: that betake themſelves to ſuch ſhameful and baſe practices, as a barbarous Pagan would bluſh, a <hi>Socrates</hi> or <hi>Ariſtides</hi> would ſwoon to behold? and ſo even <hi>teach Men wickedneſs,</hi> as God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of the Jews, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 33. or rather oftentimes do that which they are aſhamed to commit, and ſo <hi>juſtifie them in all their abominations,</hi> Jer. 2. 11. I ſpeak not this to diſgrace my Religion, or my Brother that beareth the Name of Chriſt as well as my ſelf; as though the <hi>Turks</hi> live like Men, and we like Dogs, as they are pleaſed to call us; or that there were more Atheiſm and Prophaneneſs in <hi>England,</hi> than in <hi>Italy;</hi> or that there were more Villany committed in our Churches, than in thoſe Popiſh <hi>Cages of unclean Birds;</hi> or as though <hi>Campian's</hi> Brag were true, <hi>Catholicos eſſe qui argentum reſolvant quod de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent,</hi> &amp;c. Nor yet favouring thoſe rigid Cenſurers, (however other Men bear that blame) that for any unſeemly carriage of Profeſſors cry out preſently of Hypocriſie, which in another Man would be more charitably imputed to Humane frailty: Yet we cannot but conceive how diſhonourable it is to Chriſt and the Goſpel, for the <hi>Daughters of the Philiſtines</hi> to be <hi>aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the lewd ways of Gods People,</hi> Ezek. 16. 27. for <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> (as we know <hi>Amurath</hi> the ſecond at the Battle at <hi>Varna</hi> did) to pray to Chriſt to revenge the Chriſtians Perfidy. Little do we conſider what Diſhonour God hath amongſt them by our ſinful carriage, nor how many bad turns we do, not only to <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> in keeping them off from embracing the Goſpel, which we ſo diſgrace, but likewiſe to many poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians under their Tyranny, whilſt through the Chriſtians wicked behaivour they <hi>think they do God ſervice,</hi> and a great benefit to poor Souls, whilſt they conſtrain them to Abjure their Faith and Baptiſm: And ſo we kill two at one ſtroke, namely, we harden the Perſecutor, and hazard the Chriſtian's either temporal Life, or Faith and Salvation. Thus we are an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their denving Chriſt, and in ſo doing do little better our ſelves. For <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and thoſe firſt Chriſtians thought that there was another way, than by open denying of Chriſt, to be excluded from the Name of a Chriſtian, <hi>Si faciamus quae faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt non Chriſtiani, excludimur,</hi> ſaith he. And therefore let us look to our ſelves in this reſpect: for the <hi>Jew</hi> blaſphemes Chriſt, the <hi>Turk</hi> prefers <hi>Mahomet</hi> before Him, and the poor <hi>Indian</hi> and barbarous <hi>Pagan</hi> lives like a Beaſt in a Man's ſhape.
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:56446:143"/> Theſe things, and the like, they do: Take we heed therefore leſt, whilſt we equalize or exceed them in theſe or the like, we hazard not the Benefit of our Chriſtendom.</p>
            <p>And therefore, to conclude with Exhortation, we are all to <label type="milestone">

               </label> be intreated, that whereas we all (however ſome do injuriouſly impropriate the Name, I ſay, whereas we all) would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>Evangelici,</hi> Profeſſors of the Goſpel; that we would not now deal with the Goſpel, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did with the Law, who carried it along with them in their Clothes, but not in their Hearts: So we have it only in outward Profeſſion, but expreſs it neither in Heart nor Life: But as we have a <hi>worthy Profeſſion,</hi> ſo let us <hi>walk worthy of it,</hi> and let us ever account it as our Duty (with <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 1. 16.) <hi>Not to be aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> ſo our happineſs, if we be not <hi>a ſhame to it,</hi> but rather <hi>adorn it</hi> by an holy converſation, that our Lives and the Goſpel, like two Glaſſes reflecting one upon another, may give mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al luſtre to each other; that (on the one ſide) the Goſpel may be an Argument of our praiſe, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 18. of a Brother, that <hi>his praiſe was in the Goſpel:</hi> And (on the other) we may add ſomething to its Beauty; That what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 12. all Men that look on our Lives, may confeſs of the Goſpel, that it's <hi>Holy, Juſt, and Good,</hi> when they ſee it makes us ſo.

            <p>Conſider, Laſtly, What we our ſelves are, that I may not (becauſe indeed I cannot) ſay more, we are <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And then (as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſaid) <hi>Shall ſuch Men as we</hi> do this <hi>great ſin,</hi> both <hi>againſt God</hi> and our Profeſſion? Chriſtians were wont to be able to challenge all their Accuſers, and clear themſelves of all falſe Accuſations, with a <hi>Fama ſola conſcia eſt ſcelerum Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum.</hi> Yea, <hi>Euſebius</hi> makes a Chriſtian, and one that excels in Grace, to be Terms convertible: By which Argument he proves, that <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Faithful before him, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="389" facs="tcp:56446:144"/> he ſtill excepts the Chriſtian.

               </gap>, Phil. 2. 15. <hi>Providing for things honeſt in the ſight of all Men,</hi> Rom. 12. 17. That they ſeeing our holy Demeanour, may glorifie our Saviour, whom we partly adore and partly imitate; and reverence His Goſpel, which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and <hi>adorn.</hi> And leſt any ſhould think, that thus to live belongs to them that need mind nothing elſe, and thus to <hi>adorn the Goſpel</hi> is for ſuch only, whom God hath <hi>adorned</hi> with greater <hi>Gifts,</hi> and ſet in more eminent <hi>Places,</hi> and ſo put upon greater Occaſions and <hi>Employments.</hi> Give me leave to add this, that, as I ſaid before, every ſaving Grace is part of a Chriſtians beauty, even <hi>the Feet are beautiful,</hi> Rom. 10. 15. And the Goſpel may not only be adorned by exact looking to the great things of the Law, but even in the uſe of things in themſelves indifferent. So <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Apparel becoming Women profeſſing Godlineſs,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 10. And ſo we may of the uſe of Meat and Drink, and Recreations; in all, in the leaſt we may, we muſt labour to have <hi>our Converſation as becometh the Goſpel.</hi> And for the Perſons whom this concerns, they are all, none excepted. For though (I confeſs) by how much a Man's Place and Gifts are more eminent, he be further engaged in this Duty; and ſo the Magiſtrate eſpecially is bound to look to it, that both private Carriage and publick Government be for the credit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Goſpel; and above all, we the Miniſters of the Goſpel are in a eſpecial manner betruſted with it, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 4. And therefore as it is moſt fearful, when our lives are ſo Scandalous, that with <hi>Eli's</hi> Sons we <hi>make Men abhor the Offering of the Lord,</hi> even deſpiſe that, which they ſee we ſo abuſe: So on the contrary, it would be more ſeemly for us to <hi>magnifie the Goſpel</hi> as well by our Living, as by our Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo that whilſt by the one we labour to <hi>beget Men to God,</hi> by the other (I mean a Godly life) we might as it were hang
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:56446:145"/> goodly Pictures before them, as they uſe to do before Women conceiving, that the Birth may be more beautiful; ſo that they may <hi>conceive</hi> (as <hi>Jacob</hi>'s <hi>Sheep</hi> did whilſt they looked upon <hi>the Rods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> whilſt they look upon us for Examples of decent and godly Behaviour. But though we eſpecially, yet not we only, but every Chriſtian of what rank and condition ſoever, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the credit of the Goſpel. For proof of which, I refer you only to the ſecond of the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he begins with him as the Miniſter, and for his Doctrine, he muſt ſpeak ſuch things which <hi>become ſound Doctrine,</hi> ver. 1. and for his Life, he would have him in all things <hi>ſhew himſelf a Patern of good Works, that he that is of the contrary part may be aſhamed,</hi> having no evil thing to ſpeak of him, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8. But yet withal he calleth for a <hi>Behaviour becoming Godlineſs in old Women,</hi> for they muſt be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. And for young Women, whoſe more wanton Behaviour, might have expected ſome exemption, yet he tells them that it belongs to them alſo to look to their Behaviour, <hi>that the Word of God be not blaſphemed,</hi> ver. 5. And Servants laſtly, which perhaps might have thought, they had enough to look to, if they could procure only their Maſter's profit and credit; yet in ſo doing, he tells them, there is another thing they muſt look after, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>That they adorn the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of God our Saviour in all things,</hi> ver. 10. So that the meaneſt Veſſels in God's Houſe, are <hi>Veſsels of Honour,</hi> and none in the Church ſo low, but that as his ſins may diſhonour, ſo his holy and decent Behaviour in his rank and condition may bring ſome Credit to the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Now what an happy thing would it be, if we would from the higheſt to the loweſt, ſet our ſelves in good earneſt to the Practice of this Duty? What a glorious ſight would it be to ſee the Magiſtrate governing, and the Subject obeying, the Miniſter preaching, and all of us in ſome meaſure living ſo <hi>as becometh</hi> the Goſpel? Such a well-ordered Army, where every one did ſo keep his Place and Rank, would be a Spectacle fit for an Angel's ſight and admiration. Sure they would not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med then to behold us, (as now oftentimes they are at our Abominations) but might well look at us as in a manner emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating their Divine Hierarchies, and practiſing that here, which at laſt together with them we ſhall be taken up with in Heaven for ever.</p>
            <pb n="391" facs="tcp:56446:145"/>
            <p> Which I may add as a further Motive to this Duty, and with which in a word I will conclude.</p>
            <p>Beloved, This life of ours ſhould be but a <hi>Praeludium</hi> to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which we all look after. Now there is no ſinful or unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming Behaviour of any, but all are and do that which <hi>becomes</hi> their <hi>glorious Condition,</hi> and therefore it would be well, if we would in this reſpect begin our Heaven betimes here on Earth, and labour to <hi>adorn</hi> our ſelves and <hi>the Goſpel,</hi> with thoſe Graces <hi>here,</hi> which will be the greateſt part of our Glory <hi>there.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as the <hi>Romans</hi> were wont to hang their <hi>Bullae</hi> about the Necks of their Free-born children, which, when they came to Man's Eſtate and Age, were laid aſide: So <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> in his Preface to this Epiſtle obſerves, that ſome Graces, that adorn us here, we ſhall not need there; not <hi>Faith,</hi> becauſe the Promiſe is fulfilled; not <hi>Repentance,</hi> becauſe no Sin to cauſe it; nor <hi>Bountifulneſs,</hi> becauſe no Poor to receive it (which yet in this our Non-age we muſt in part be adorned with). But beſides there are others, as Holineſs and Purity, Love of God and our Brethren, and the like common to both Eſtates; here defective, but there made fully perfect. And in regard of all, even whilſt we are here below, we muſt labour to have <hi>our Converſation in Heaven,</hi> Phil. 3. 20. Begin to do that now, which we ſhall do there for ever: Begin to Tune and Sing that <hi>new Song</hi> (in the <hi>Revelation)</hi> here, which will be turned into thoſe Heavenly <hi>Hallelujahs,</hi> there to be Sounded out by us with the whole Quire of Heaven to our everlaſting comforts.</p>

            <p>COncerning this <hi>Pſalm</hi> in general, I muſt not ſay much: Yet this, That if St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> had it preſented to him ſleeping, in the likeneſs of the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> in the midſt of the Paradiſe (as ſome ſay he had) I think it was a <hi>Viſion,</hi> and no Dream: And if another compare it ſet <note place="margin">Ambroſe.</note> amongſt the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> to the Sun in the midſt of the reſt of the Planets, in ſome reſpect the Compariſon will ſuit well. Or if a third tell us that it contains in it all the Precepts of Faith and <note place="margin">Hilar.</note> Obedience, I think he ſaid true. <hi>Quanto apertior, tanto profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dior;</hi> it was <hi>Auſtin's</hi> Judgment of it; and if we will believe him that ſaid it, if we ſhould ſpend our whole lives in ſtudying it (though we ſhould not loſe our labours, yet) we ſhould not fully underſtand it, for it (as our Text ſaith the reſt of God's Word is) <hi>is exceeding broad.</hi> If nothing elſe, yet the Author's Alphabetical diſpoſing of it telleth us, there is ſomething in it more than ordinary, as being worth his more artificial Penning, and our more diligent Endeavour to have it as ready in our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, as the very Letters of our Alphabet. The Author is either altogether unknown, or at leaſt as <hi>Calvin</hi> thinks, uncertain. Yet me-thinks, their Opinion is very probable, who think, that it ſuits well with the ſtrain of the <hi>ſweet Singer of Iſrael,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the ſweeteſt <hi>Songs of Zion.</hi> But upon what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it was framed, and with what coherence of parts Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters generally ſay not, nor liſt I to conjecture. Only this we may obſerve for both, that as his chief aim through the whole is to <hi>magnifie God's Word</hi> and Law (which therefore he maketh honourable mention of under different Titles in every Verſe ſave one, as ſome obſerve, though I think four more may be excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted). <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 22.</note> And for Coherence, what-ever reference one <hi>Ogdoad</hi> hath to another, that in every one of them he ſpeaks to ſome one
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:56446:146"/> thing in general; which is particularly ſet out in the ſeveral Verſes of it: A taſte of both which we may have in this, out of which the Text is taken: In which the Author, whoſoever he was, <hi>Tanquam taederet eum mutabilitatis hominum,</hi> (as he ſpeaks) as it were now wearied with the Mutability of outward Occurrences, caſts the Anchor of his Soul in the unchangeable Truth, and Word of God; which he found ſettled in Heaven, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. and in Earth, <hi>ver,</hi> 2. in all things, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. in his own Perſon and Occaſions, (in the four following) and therefore with an heavenly <hi>Epiphonema</hi> he makes the firſt and laſt Verſe ſound both the ſame Note. There he begins, <hi>For ever, O Lord, thy Word is ſettled in Heaven:</hi> And he here ends with the ſame, <hi>I have ſeen an end of all Perfection, but thy Commandment is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding broad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words the large Extent, and eternal Duration of God's Word is ſet out, by comparing it with the narrow ſcantneſs and ſhort continuance of all other Contentments. He had <hi>ſeen an end of all</hi> ſuch <hi>Perfections:</hi> But none of God's Word, <hi>Thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is exceeding broad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt words, (in which (though contrary to my firſt purpoſe) my preſent Diſcourſe muſt be bounded) this <hi>end of Perfection,</hi> ſome make Martyrdome; many of the <hi>Latine</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Chriſt. The <hi>Greek,</hi> whom our later Divines in this uſually follow, by this <hi>all Perfection</hi> underſtand either all this inferiour and viſible World, containing in it the divers Degrees and Perfections of things, and therefore called <hi>all Perfection:</hi> Or Metonymically by <hi>Perfection</hi> is meant, whatever particular thing either for Nature or Quality is moſt perfect and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, the ſight of all which Satan thought would have dazled our Saviour's, and therefore we might have thought would have eaſily blinded <hi>David's</hi> eyes: But by his wiſe Obſervation, and piercing Eye of Faith, he ſaith, he <hi>hath ſeen:</hi> If you ask, what? The words of the Text anſwer, but having a double Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis: 1. Not any meaner or ordinary Contentments, but the top and choiſe of <hi>all Perfections.</hi> And, 2. Not one of them, or ſome, or few, but <hi>all;</hi> and yet through them all ſomething beſide: <hi>He had ſeen an end of all Perfection.</hi> As though what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he could ſee, he could ſee an <hi>end</hi> of it; and that <hi>end,</hi> as I take it, double; of length, of breadth; of length and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, that whereas God's <hi>Word is for ever ſettled in Heaven,</hi> ver. 1. He <hi>ſeeth an end,</hi> a Period of thoſe lower and fading <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;</hi>
               <pb n="394" facs="tcp:56446:147"/> and of breadth and extent (as we may gather from the Oppoſition in the end of the Verſe) they are too ſcant and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to cover all our Nakedneſs and Defects; but God's <hi>Word</hi> as for continuance, can reach to all Times, ſo for breadth and extent to all Perſons and Wants. <hi>But thy Commandment is exceeding broad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Truth then, which from theſe firſt words I am now to <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> handle, in full ſenſe is plainly thus much:</p>
            <p>That not any, not all the beſt of theſe things below will laſt, or can help always.</p>
            <p>The firſt Vanity is, That they laſt not. <hi>I have ſeen an end of all Perfection,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> And ſure, what he by the Spirit ſaith he ſaw, we may believe is true, for the was a <hi>Prophet of God,</hi> and they were called <hi>Seers;</hi> and whatever ours do in other Matters, certainly their Eye-ſight in ſuch things as theſe never failed them. This our Seer therefore, having as it were got to the Top of ſome high Mountain (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> expreſſeth it) from thence, as our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 8. had a view of <hi>all the Kingdoms of the World,</hi> and the <hi>Glory,</hi> the <hi>Perfection</hi> of them. He ſaw all this, but withal ſomething beſide; and therefore as that <hi>Watchman,</hi> Iſa. 21. 11, 12. being asked <hi>what he ſaw,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Advenerat mane, ſed etiam nox venit,</hi> (as <hi>Junius</hi> readeth it): There had been a lightſome Morning, but ended in a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Night. So our Watchman here being asked what he ſaw, anſwers, he had ſeen much, even <hi>all Perfection,</hi> but withal <hi>an end of all: I have ſeen an end of all Perfection, but thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is exceeding broad.</hi> Juſt the ſame with a part of the Viſion of another of God's <hi>Seers,</hi> Iſa. 40. 6, 8. <hi>The Voice ſaid cry. And he ſaid, What ſhall I cry? All fleſh is graſs and all the goodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof as the Flower of the Field. The Graſs withereth, and the Flower fadeth: But the Word of our God abideth for ever.</hi> In which words, I have a ſufficient Draught of what I need ſpeak in this particular. For hence we ſee, 1. That all things are but <hi>as Graſs.</hi> 2. That all the <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Perfection of</hi> them, but <hi>as the Flower of Graſs,</hi> and therefore both ſubject to decay; either to wither of themſelves, or to be cut down, or pluckt up by others.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For <hi>all things</hi> in general, I only ſay this, that the round World is but like a round Ball wrapt up of broken Threads, amongſt which there may be ſome ends of Gold and Silver: So that whilſt Men oftentimes (as they think) are ſpinning a
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:56446:147" rendition="simple:additions"/> fair Thread, either it comes to the end, or (as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (the word in the Text) comes of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifieth to cut off,) the Hand of God <hi>cuts</hi> either it or <hi>us off,</hi> as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> complains, <hi>Iſa</hi> 38. 10, 12. and ſo we are left in the Laby<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inth, contrary to our former Expectation, and without hope of future recovery. All th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ngs in the Earth, as the Earth it ſelf, are <hi>founded on nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, But the Text calls me to view rather the <hi>Pefection</hi> of things, which is like <hi>the Flower of the Graſs,</hi> and hath this above it, that as it is more beautiful, ſo more ſubject to ſpeedy Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration: For how often have we ſeen Wiſdom, and Strength, and Beauty, and Riches, and the like Perfections, gone before the Man that had them? How often have we ſeen Wiſdom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caied, and the old Man left indeed, but left childiſhly doting? Riches <hi>flown away,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh, but leaving a Begger behind them? Strength and Beauty gone too, but ſo as leaving Weakneſs and Deformity in their room? So that if you ſhould diſtil the Quinteſſence and <hi>Perfection of all things here,</hi> as it would be contained in a narrow room, ſo a ſhort time will put a period to it's continuance. His ſubſtance ſhall not continue, neither <hi>ſhall he prolong the Perfection thereof upon the Earth,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> Job 15. 29. The word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> there, and only there uſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Writers, as by us generally, expounded <hi>Perfection:</hi> But the Septuagint there expreſs it by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow:</hi> It may be thereby to ſet forth what kind of <hi>Perfections</hi> ariſe from outward things. We and they both, like <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,</hi> may ſhew greater than we are, and yet <hi>ſhadows</hi> ſtill, that laſt not. And the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> uſed in the Text, and no where elſe, ſeemeth alſo to imitate ſome ſuch thing as coming from <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> that ſignifieth <hi>Deficere,</hi> as well as <hi>Perficere.</hi> Such defe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctive Perfections, and ſuch ſpending and decaying Felicities are all ſuch, as he that ſees and finds the moſt, can find in outward Contentments. Or if a third word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> which is uſed in this kind ſeem in its ſignification to promiſe longer Continuance; yet <hi>Eliphaz</hi> cuts it ſhort too, <hi>Job</hi> 4. <hi>ult. Doth not the excellency</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

But not to trouble you with Grammatical Speculations; in a word, if you would take the full length and breadth of all theſe Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, uſe no better Inſtrument than that of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 39. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="396" facs="tcp:56446:148"/> his beſt, or moſt <hi>ſettled</hi> eſtate, as the word ſignifieth. So that when he is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> ſo <hi>ſettled</hi> as with <hi>David,</hi> he thinks <hi>he ſhall never be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;</hi> even oftentimes then he falls down head-long. For how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten after many dangers paſt at Sea doth a Ship now fairly fraugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſink in Havens mouth? How often have you ſeen Men ſo long in cutting out their Fortune, that at length they marr all, wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up themſelves to the higheſt Peg, and then crack? And labouring to frame I know not what Caſtles in the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>k is well nigh reared up, and they on the top of it, then one Pin ſlips, or one Pillar, on which it ſtands, is ſuddenly taken away, and ſo all prove Caſtle-come-downs. Thus <hi>finis conſummationis,</hi> and <hi>Interitus,</hi> often take one another by the Heel; or at the beſt, it is with outward Eſtates as it is with our High-ways in Summer-time, they are then ſo fair and firm, that we think it well nigh impoſſible, that ever they ſhould prove ſo fowl and deep, as in <hi>Winter</hi> we find them. It's ſo in our Summer-weather of Proſperity. Our <hi>Perfection</hi> ſo high (we think) as above all <hi>Winter</hi> ſhowres and Tempeſts: <hi>The Kings of the Earth, and all the Inhabitants of the World, would not have believed, that the Adverſary ſhould have entered into the Gates of Jeruſalem,</hi> Lamen. 4. 12. they would not believe it, nor (which was worſt) would ſhe. <hi>She remembred not her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end.</hi> But mark what follows: <hi>Therefore ſhe came down won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully,</hi> Lamen. 1. 9. Such and ſo brittle are the beſt of theſe lower Perfections, like Glaſſes ſhine bright, but even then are broken; like falſhes, give ſome light for the time, but are ſoon out; or like ſo many Bubbles that are higher indeed, than the reſt of the Water; and ſome remain a ſhorter, and ſome a longer time: But yet it's not long before they all vaniſh. For <hi>I have ſeen,</hi> ſaith David, <hi>the end of all Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this <hi>univerſal (All)</hi> ſeems to require an <hi>Induction,</hi> to prove it by <hi>particulars.</hi> In which, that I may not fetch too large a Compaſs, I follow only that ordinary diviſion of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> of <hi>Mind,</hi> of <hi>Body,</hi> of <hi>outward Eſtate,</hi> and but glance at ſome of the chief, without troubling you with a full view of any.</p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>Perfections</hi> of the <hi>Mind,</hi> let them (in groſs) be Underſtanding, and Wiſdom: Which, though I confeſs, have the ſtart of all that follow, as being ſeated in an everlaſting Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; yet, <hi>We ſee that Wiſe Men die as well as Fools,</hi> Pſal. 49. 10. and ſometimes their Wiſdom before them. <hi>David</hi> had ſeen
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:56446:148"/> 
               <hi>Abitophel's Wiſdom</hi> ending in <hi>Fooliſhneſs.</hi> And we have read of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar's <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> changed into <hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rutiſhneſs.</hi> God can <hi>make the Judges fools,</hi> Job 12. 17. Diſuſe can make the moſt expert forgetful. The Plague at <hi>Athens,</hi> and many Diſeaſes ſince could deprive the Wiſeſt of Underſtanding and Memory at once. And if all fail, yet Old-age (as they fain of <hi>Saturn)</hi> moſt commonly devours that Wiſdom, which it begets: Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, like an Unthrift, in a ſhort time ſpends what his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors were a long time in getting. So that the Ancients <hi>that teach Wiſdom,</hi> as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Job.</hi> 32. 7. ſometimes prove childiſh: Old Men often dote before they die, and though their Soul be ready to take its flight, yet the ſtrength of Underſtanding takes leave firſt, and prevents it. In a word, if it be no more than the <hi>Wiſdom of the World,</hi> or of the <hi>Princes of the World,</hi> it (as the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. telleth us they do) will <hi>come to nought,</hi> and ſo you ſee an end of that <hi>Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if it fare ſo with the Soul, we cannot think that the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Body,</hi> which comes ſo ſhort of it in worth, can exceed it in continuance; for it's but an <hi>Houſe of Clay;</hi> and therefore all the Paint and Varniſh it can have muſt decay either with it, or before it. See it in the particulars, which eſpecially are three, Health, Strength, and Beauty.</p>
            <p>For Health, I need ſay no more, than what St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaid before me, <hi>Quaenam eſt iſta ſalus Corporis, quae morte premitur, quae aegritudine debilitatur, frivola, mortalis, fluxa?</hi> IN a word, let him that never hath been ſick, and is ſure never ſhall be, ſay that Health will laſt always. But our Experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, that the Phyſician who often reſtores our Health, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not always maintain his own; that there is ſuch contrariety of Humours, ſuch well-nigh Infinitneſs of imbred Diſeaſes, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny outward occaſions of Diſtemper, that few or none in our well days are perfectly free: However, Old-age comes limping on a-pace, which will bring more <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> than we can before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand provide <hi>Remedies.</hi> Or it may be before that, as it was obſerved, that grievous Plague at <hi>Athens</hi> followed upon a moſt healthful fore-going year; ſo our moſt healthful years may be overtaken with untimely Deaths. And thus <hi>one dieth</hi> (ſaith Job) <hi>in his full ſtrength, being wholly at eaſe and quiet,</hi> Chap. 21. 23. And ſo an end of that Perfection. And when <hi>Health</hi> is gone, we cannot think that <hi>Strength</hi> will ſtay behind; for they always ſtay and go together. The ſame Diſeaſe, that hinders the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:56446:149"/> one, weakens the other. And ſo the luſty young Man often comes to ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 23. <hi>He hath weakned my ſtrength in the way.</hi> But if not ſo, be ſure it will begin to faint in the end of the Journey. If <hi>Plinies</hi> Miracle were true, that one <hi>Xenophilus</hi> lived one hundred and five years without any Diſeaſe, yet I cannot believe that he was another <hi>Moſes,</hi> that his <hi>natural force was not abated;</hi> for in ordinary courſe that part of <hi>Solomon's</hi> deſcription of Old-age is true, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>The time will come, when the ſtrong Men ſhall bow:</hi> When old <hi>Milo</hi> may look on his withered Arms, and weep and ſay, <hi>at hi quidem mortui jam ſunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>ſtrong Mountains fall and come to nought,</hi> Job. 14. 18. &amp;c. <hi>Huzzab,</hi> (or that which is moſt <hi>eſtabliſhed)</hi> is <hi>led away Captive,</hi> Nahum. 2. 7. And (to add no more) in the third Chapter of the ſame Prophecy, at the ninth Verſe, <hi>Ethiopia and Egypt were her ſtrength, and it was infinite,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> (that is) <hi>and there was no end:</hi> The ſame word almoſt both there and here, ſo that you might begin to think of a Contradiction, but if we ſhall read on, we ſhall find none; and therefore it's added, for all her <hi>infinite ſtrength,</hi> ſhe <hi>was carried</hi> away; <hi>She went into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,</hi> ver. 10. And there we ſee an <hi>end of that Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if theſe more ſubſtantial <hi>Perfections</hi> ſo ſoon vaniſh, we may well think, the leaſt Breath will blow off all the Paint of <hi>Beauty,</hi> which ſo many pride themſelves in; and therefore if any ſhall <hi>truſt</hi> in it, (as ſhe did, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 15.) they ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly find that true, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 30. <hi>Favour is a lie, and Beauty is vain:</hi> Any ſickneſs can ſpoil it for the time, and ſome for alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Or if it miſs them, be ſure <hi>it will conſume in the Grave,</hi> Pſal. 49. 14. <hi>Thou changeſt his Countenance, and ſendeſt him away,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job, Chap.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 20. And <hi>David</hi> had ſeen his ruddy Complexion and beautiful Countenance altered, and ſo <hi>an end of that Perfection:</hi> A poor one, that's only in the outward Skin, which if flea'd off, leaves a deformed Anatomy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Life</hi> is yet behind, a <hi>Perfection</hi> ariſing from Body and Soul united; but yet this <hi>Shadow</hi> (1 Chron. 29. 15.) ſoon gone, this <hi>Poſt,</hi> this <hi>Ship,</hi> Job 9. 25, 26. ſoon <hi>paſt by:</hi> This <hi>Flower,</hi> Job 14. 2. ſoon withered; this <hi>Vapour,</hi> James 4. 14. ſoon <hi>vaniſheth:</hi> This <hi>Smoak,</hi> Pſal. 102. 3. ſoon blown away; of it ſelf it would be gone; and therefore we have thoſe Phraſes of God's <hi>keeping our ſoul in Life,</hi> Pſal. 66. 9. And <hi>withholding it from Death,</hi> Pſal. 78. 50. But if we conſider all that continually either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:56446:149"/> or aſſault it, the livelieſt Man in his beſt Health may ſay with <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 20. 3. <hi>There is but a ſtep between me and death.</hi> Or if he live longer, and it may be longer than he hath comfort, yet <hi>Methuſelah,</hi> that went the faireſt of any for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, after he had lived 969 years, yet <hi>he died,</hi> Gen. 5. 27.

            <p>So that I need not now ſpeak any thing of that third kind of <hi>Perfections</hi> without us, which, as they are of leſs <hi>Worth,</hi> ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of leſs <hi>Continuance.</hi> If <hi>Riches</hi> be the <hi>Perfection</hi> thou aimeſt at, let me tell thee, that as it is but <hi>low,</hi> ſo it is not <hi>laſting;</hi> for the Goſpel tells us, that <hi>The rich Man died, and was buried.</hi> And, <hi>Wilt thou cauſe thine eyes to flie upon that which is not?</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 23. 5. A ſtrange kind of Speech we would think, that uſe to call our Riches our <hi>Goods and Subſtance.</hi> He thinks them to be neither, but calls them plain <hi>Non-entia;</hi> or if they have any being, yet ſo uncertain, that he would not have us <hi>flie</hi> ſo eagerly upon them in our deſires, <hi>as the Eagle upon the Prey,</hi> (in the beginning of the Verſe) which uſe <hi>to make themſelves Wings, and flie away as the Eagle towards Heaven;</hi> as he ſhews in the end of it. It's not good therefore to have our Treaſure in a Jewel, hanged about ſuch an Eagle's neck, which may ſoon <hi>flie away,</hi> it may be never to return again. <hi>Flie away as the Eagle towards Heaven,</hi> and that's moſt ſwiftly: Witneſs that one Day, that ſaw <hi>Job</hi> both on the Throne, and on the Dung-hill; for God may blow, the Moth may fret, the Ruſt may canker, the Thief may break through, ſo that <hi>a rich Man lieth down,</hi> but either through Malice of ſome, or Careleſneſs of others, when <hi>he opens his eyes, he is not,</hi> namely what he was. Or, <hi>there is nothing,</hi> as ſome read that place, <hi>Job</hi> 27. 19. Thus the <hi>Golden City ceaſeth,</hi> Iſa. 14. 4. and though in one ſenſe, there be <hi>no end of thy Riches,</hi> as it is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 7. Yet aſſuredly either they will vaniſh, or, as St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou wilt vaniſh in them.</hi> Only take heed, that the end of them bring not an end to thy Comfort. Take heed of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his Doom, <hi>Thy Money periſh with thee,</hi> both thou and it together. But it may be thou wilt ſay, that <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Promotion</hi> will lift thee up, <hi>as upon Eagles wings,</hi> above all ſuch Diſaſters. And I would believe thee, if I were not bound to believe God rather, who hath ſaid it in his Word, that <hi>Man being in Honour abideth not,</hi>
               <pb n="400" facs="tcp:56446:150"/> Pſal. 49. 12. Or if the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> had not ſeen ſuch <hi>Wings</hi> as theſe <hi>pluckt,</hi> Dan. 7. 4. and the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> had not ſeen them flying away. <hi>As for Ephraim, their Glory ſhall flie away as a Bird,</hi> Chap. 9. 11. If I had not heard that <hi>Voice from Heaven</hi> to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Thy Kingdom is departed from thee:</hi> If I had not ſeen <hi>an Hand-writing before Belſhazzar on the Wall, Meneh, Meneh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>God hath numbered thy Kingdom, and finiſhed it.</hi> Thus the <hi>Royal City is taken,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 26. Oftentimes thoſe that have been in higheſt places, after a while have been caſt aſide, <hi>as a Veſſel, in which there is no pleaſure:</hi> Yea, even <hi>Princes breath goeth forth, he returns to the Earth, and then all his thoughts periſh,</hi> Pſal. 146. 4. <gap reason="foreign">

Which if you would but take up, and look into the Graves and Tombs of thoſe <hi>Chief ones of the Earth,</hi> (as the <hi>Prophet</hi> calls them) when nothing elſe is left, their very Bones would ſpeak and ſay, <hi>We have been ſomething;</hi> yea, <hi>all things,</hi> (as dying <hi>Severus</hi> ſaid of himſelf) but now are nothing: And ſo you have <hi>an end</hi> likewiſe <hi>of that Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What ſhould I now ſpeak further of <hi>multitude of Friends,</hi> whoſe Friendſhip uſually ends with our Wealth, and themſelves often before? Where ever we come, either a <hi>Widdow of Tekoah</hi> lamenting, that <hi>her Husband is dead;</hi> or a <hi>David</hi> bewailing the untimely death of a faithful <hi>Jonathan,</hi> or a beloved <hi>Abſalom;</hi> or a <hi>Centurion</hi> ſeeking for the Health of a <hi>Servant that is dear to him;</hi> but <hi>now ready to die,</hi> do all cry aloud, that there is <hi>an end of that Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be <hi>delicate Fare</hi> thou affecteſt, thou muſt know that it could not keep <hi>Dives</hi> from <hi>Hell.

            <p>If coſtly Apparel, know that <hi>as thou cameſt in, ſo thou muſt go out of the World naked.</hi> Or if thy Friends will vainly ſpend as much on thy Carcaſe, when thou art dead, as thou doſt on it now when thou art alive, yet be ſure (as <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid he would have it) <hi>thou ſhalt be Judged naked.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="401" facs="tcp:56446:150"/>
            <p> To add no more, If they be <hi>goodly Buildings</hi> in which thou ſeateſt thy Self and thy <hi>Perfection,</hi> yet (as <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 5, 6.) the left Ruines of ſuch vaſt Edifices do plainly witneſs, that, if there were no Lightning to conſume, nor Wind to overturn, nor Cannon to beat down, yet Time would undermine the ſtrongeſt. <hi>I will ſmite the Winter-Houſe, and the Summer-Houſe, and the Houſes of Ivory ſhall periſh, and the great Houſes ſhall have an end, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Amos 3. 15. And ſo <hi>an end</hi> of that <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we have ſeen <hi>ſome</hi> of this <hi>All;</hi> which (that I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to my firſt Draught) are (we ſee) but <hi>as Graſs,</hi> or <hi>the Flower of the Field;</hi> and, as they have a double <hi>end,</hi> which I muſt now briefly point at, either wither of themſelves, or are pluckt up or cut down by others.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſay, Of themſelves they will wither; compared to <hi>Summer-Fruits,</hi> Amos 8. 2. which are pleaſant, but laſt not, repreſented by <hi>Wheels</hi> in <hi>Ezekiel's</hi> Viſion, and therefore ever turning, and by <hi>the Moon,</hi> Rev. 12. 1. and therefore often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying. All that I would ſay in this particular, we have ſumm'd up, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 17. <hi>And the World paſseth away, and the Luſt thereof.</hi> The whole <hi>World.</hi> that is now <hi>grown old,</hi> ſhall ſhortly have <hi>an end,</hi> (which is the end, as ſome think, in the Text, which <hi>David</hi> by Faith foreſaw) and <hi>the Luſt thereof;</hi> whether you take it <hi>paſſively</hi> with <hi>Calvin, Concupiſcentia</hi> for <hi>Quicquid concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcitur,</hi> for that which is moſt deſirable, and ſo the ſame with <hi>Perfection</hi> in the Text: Or, actively with others for our Deſire and Affection after it; though the World ſhould continue, yet both it's Deſirableneſs, and our Deſire of it, <hi>will paſs away.</hi> This <hi>Flower of the Field</hi> often loſeth its <hi>ſweet Smell</hi> before its <hi>Beauty</hi> The beſt of the former <hi>Perfections</hi> often ceaſe to <hi>pleaſe</hi> and <hi>content,</hi> before they ceaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to <hi>be;</hi> and that either from a Satiety, which they bring, and ſo often the young Man is weary of his Luſt, and partly from a Weakneſs and Indiſpoſition in us; and ſo the old Man ſaith, <hi>(Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 1.) <hi>I have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in them.</hi> And ſo we ſee, if left to themſelves, there will be this way <hi>an end of all Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, But how often (in the ſecond place) is this <hi>Flower</hi> pluckt in the <hi>Bud,</hi> before it be fully <hi>blown?</hi> And the <hi>Graſs</hi> cut down, before it come to it's full height? How often are theſe outward Contentments taken away, before either they, or our deſire, come to the <hi>Perfection? For before the Harveſt, when the</hi>
               <pb n="402" facs="tcp:56446:151"/> 
               <hi>Bud is perfect, and the ſowre Grape is ripening in the Flower, he ſhall cut off the Sprigs with pruning-hooks, and take away the Branches,</hi> Iſa. 18. 5. Yea, How often, when theſe Perfections and our Deſires have grown up together, and are now married, they affording, and we receiving moſt Contentment, are they violently pluckt aſunder? Thus, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 9. <hi>Lebanon is aſhamed and cut down, and Sharon is like a Wilderneſs, and Baſhan and Carmel ſhake off their Fruit.</hi> When <hi>Babel</hi> is moſt ſtately, and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> admiring, I know not whether it, or himſelf more, and ſaying, <hi>Is not this great Babel?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Even while the word was in his Mouth, there fell a Voice from Heaven, ſaying, O King Nebuchadnezzar, To thee, even to thee it's ſpoken; the Kingdom is now departed from thee.</hi> Thus the Pſalmiſt ſaw <hi>the Wicked flouriſhing:</hi> And that you may think is not much, becauſe <hi>Autumn</hi> might be at hand and then ſuch flouriſhing Trees left bare and naked; but it's added <hi>as a green Bay tree.</hi> And that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to promiſe Continuance, againſt which the Winter-froſts do not uſually prevail. <hi>He ſaw it,</hi> but it was but once, for he <hi>looked</hi> again and <hi>ſought</hi> it, <hi>but it could not be found,</hi> Pſal. 37 35, 36. And all that he then ſaw, was this in the Text, <hi>An end of all Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus, in both theſe reſpects, we ſee plainly, that all the fore-named and the like Perfections are indeed but like Puddles or ſhallow Waters, in which you may, as you think, ſee the Sun and Moon, and conceive them as deep as the Heaven is high, which if you ſhall try, you ſhall find far otherwiſe: And that, as a Shower made them, ſo the next Sun-ſhine will dry them up. Theſe outward Conten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ments make a ſhow of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more Depth and Solidity, than upon trial we ſhall find in them. They are but Puddles for Swine to wallow in, impure, unconſtant; ſo that what was ſaid of <hi>Elijah's,</hi> 1 Kings 17. 7. <hi>After a while the Brook dried up,</hi> may be ſaid of all theſe broken Ciſterns, and <hi>deceitful Brooks,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> called his Friends, <hi>At the end of a few days</hi> (as the phraſe there is). We all that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent here, all that are any where alive, ſhall be laid low; and at the end of ſome few Years, there will come a laſt <hi>end of all,</hi> (take it as large as you will) an univerſal <hi>end of all Perfection.</hi> And ſo we have done with the firſt <hi>Vanity;</hi> the <hi>end</hi> of Length and <hi>Continuance,</hi> they will not laſt always.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The other <hi>end,</hi> which <hi>David</hi> ſaw, is of Breadth and Extent. Whereas God's Word is <hi>exceeding broad,</hi> (that is)
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:56446:151" rendition="simple:additions"/> reaching to all Perſons, and all their Occaſions and Wants; theſe lower <hi>Perfections</hi> are but narrow and ſcant, and therefore (as I ſaid) cannot help always: And that will appear in theſe two Caſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In the want of any one of them. For though (as I ſhall ſhew afterward) all together cannot perfectly cover us, yet the Want of any one of them will leave that part of a Man bare (as they feign of <hi>Achilles</hi> his Heel) in which a Man may be wounded, and that mortally, though it be but between <hi>the joints of Ahab's Harneſs;</hi> who though he had a Kingdom, if he have no: <hi>Naboth's Vineyard,</hi> is <hi>heavy,</hi> and <hi>diſcontented.</hi> And <hi>Haman,</hi> though he can make a Buſineſs of it to <hi>ſend for, and tell his Wife and Friends</hi> (I doubt not like a jolly Man) <hi>of the Glory of his Riches, and the Multitude of his Children, and all the things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the King hath promoted him,</hi> well-nigh as large as this <hi>all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> in the Text; yet, <hi>All this doth not avail him, as long as Mordecai ſits in the King's Gate, and will not riſe up to him,</hi> Eſth. 5. 11, 13. So, if a Man have <hi>Riches,</hi> but with <hi>Diſgrace,</hi> he is but like a Fool in a Velvet coat: Or if both without <hi>Health,</hi> but like a gouty Leg upon a Velvet Cuſhion. If he have not <hi>all,</hi> he hath not <hi>enough;</hi> and <hi>to have all,</hi> is more than ever any could yet attain to. One of the <hi>Graces</hi> ever uſe to look from us. And therefore, as <hi>Ezekiel, Chap.</hi> 15. 5. ſpeaks in a like caſe: <hi>Behold when it was whole, it was meet for no work: How much leſs when the Fire hath devoured it,</hi> or any part of it? So let me here; If all <hi>Perfections</hi> taken together will not cover all, much leſs will they be able, when any one or more of them are wanting.</p>
            <p>2. But ſuppoſe any Man ſo happy, that he thinks he can ſay with the <hi>Church of Laodicea, I am Rich, and increaſed in Goods, and have need of nothing.</hi> Suppoſe a Man ſhould have ſuch Skill, as to make up a patcht Garment of all theſe outward <hi>Perfections;</hi> a goodly Suit, I confeſs, it would ſeem, and be as highly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by moſt, as thoſe <hi>party-coloured Coats</hi> were in former time: Though, I think, none ever yet wore it; yet ſuppoſe, I ſay, that any ſhould, yet I muſt ſay with the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 20. <hi>That this Covering is narrower, than that a Man can wrap himſelf in it.</hi> His Soul is larger than all this can reach to. There is an inward Man, which all this while they ſee not, that is yet all naked and bare. There is a <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which, it may be, they now feel not, but which one day they will feel, and find fearfully
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:56446:152"/> wounded: And to a Man in ſuch a caſe, theſe outward Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings will be but like a ſilken Suit to a Body, that hath all the Bones out of joynt. There will one day come an Hour of Death, when all our Riches cannot purchaſe either <hi>Delivery,</hi> or <hi>Reprieve;</hi> and at laſt there will be a day of <hi>Arraignment</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> which our greateſt ſtate now, cannot then exempt from. At ſuch times all theſe <hi>Perfections</hi> oftentimes are as ſo many Daggers at our Hearts. Either they, or our bad uſe of them, wound then deep and deadly. Then <hi>Abſolom's Hair</hi> is his <hi>Halter,</hi> and <hi>Sampſon's</hi> Strength his Ruine. Then Men's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Glory</hi> their <hi>Shame,</hi> and their Riches like a Horſe to a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, which may help in the way; but they now find trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and chargeable at the Journy's end. Thrice happy then the mighteſt Potentate, if he had but Authority then left him, as to command his Conſcience ſilence: And happy then the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Wretch, whoſe only <hi>Perfection</hi> here is to be covered and buried in Gold and Silver; if all the Shillings and Pounds, which he had got by Uſury and Extortion, laid all then together could but cover that one ſin, or buy but <hi>One drop of Water to cool his Tongue, when he is tormented in the flame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus at laſt we have ſeen theſe <hi>All Perfections,</hi> as for Length they laſt not for all Times, ſo for Breadth they reach not to our inward and greateſt Wants; and ſo in both Senſes, <hi>an end of all Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Application of all is, That we now would labour for <label type="milestone">

               <hi>David's</hi> Eyes, and uſe them as he did; that as with one we ſee theſe <hi>Perfections,</hi> ſo with another we would look at <hi>the end</hi> of them: Or rather with the ſame Eye of Faith, look through all this ſeeming <hi>Perfection</hi> to <hi>the end of all.</hi> Our <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Eyes</hi> therefore ſhould not be terminated in theſe Out-ſides of things. We ſhould not ſtand gazing with <hi>Achan</hi> upon the <hi>Wedge of Gold,</hi> and <hi>goodly Babyloniſh Garment,</hi> leſt, as it was with him, they <hi>ſteal away our Hearts</hi> and Happineſs together. I confeſs it is with many of our Worldly Men, as they ſay, it is with ſome of your devout Pilgrims to <hi>Mahomet's</hi> Tomb, who after that goodly ſight uſe to pore ſo long on hot Iron, till they loſe their Eye-ſight. Ours (I do not ſay, Pilgrims and Strangers, unleſs it be from <hi>God and the Common-wealth of Iſrael)</hi> do uſe to gaze ſo long on the Luſtre of outward Vanities, that they loſe both Eyes and Hearts, by which they might deſire and find more divine and laſting <hi>Perfections.</hi> Thus did not <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 31. 26.
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:56446:152"/> He <hi>beheld not the Sun when it ſhined, nor the Moon walking in brightneſs:</hi> (that is) The Glory of his outward Happineſs, as ſome from the Context expound it. And though <hi>David's</hi> Eyes had once a miſt caſt before them, when he thought his <hi>Mountain ſo ſtrong that he ſhould never be moved;</hi> yet here he is now gotten, as we heard, upon another Mountain, and from thence ſeeth further than he did before, or others that lie gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veling below can, even to <hi>an end of all this Perfection.</hi> He doth not now admire and adore this Glorious Light; but, as they tell us, they can with their Glaſſes diſcern Motes in the Sun: So he by Faith (the beſt Proſpective) ſeeth Motes in this Sun, to even <hi>an end of all Perfection.</hi> And happy ſure were his Eyes, that ſaw ſuch things, which many other Kings and great Ones (I do not ſay, <hi>deſire to ſee,</hi> but in truth) never ſaw, whoſe <hi>inward thought</hi> ſometimes is, that <hi>their Houſes ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for ever,</hi> and <hi>their Dwelling-places to all Generations,</hi> Pſal. 49. 11. And it may be, as though they could either over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreſtle, or out-laſt the Almighty and Everlaſting God, in their Hearts, ſay with them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 4. <hi>He ſhall not ſee our laſt end.</hi> Or if God ſometimes <hi>make them to ſee</hi> it, either by others Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, or the inward light of their own Conſcience, preſently they ſhut their Eyes, and <hi>will not:</hi> They over-look it, at leaſt they do not with <hi>David</hi> here ſet themſelves ſeriouſly to mark and conſider it. They do not with him elſe-where pray, that God would <hi>teach them to number their days,</hi> Pſal. 90. 12. And that he would <hi>make them to know their end, and how frail they are,</hi> Pſal. 39. 4. Unleſs it be in a Paſſion, (as ſome think this later Speech of <hi>David</hi> was ſpoken) thoughts of <hi>their end</hi> never come welcome. You cannot do them a worſe turn, than by putting them in mind of their Mortality. But it would be well that we with <hi>David</hi> here would be continually thinking of ours. And that</p>
            <p n="1">1. To keep us humble; that when we are in this kind <hi>perfect in our ways,</hi> as we have the Phraſe of the <hi>Prince of Tyre,</hi> Ezek. 28. 15. we be not like him, <hi>lift up,</hi> and ſo grow contumelious to God or Man, leſt we come to his <hi>end,</hi> which in that Chapter is excellently deſcribed; that with <hi>Jeſurun,</hi> when we <hi>are grown fat, we kick not againſt God,</hi> or with thoſe Idol-Shepherds, ſtamp upon and tread under foot his Children; that now in this joyful time, we do not revel it with <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> and with thoſe drunken Prophets, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 12. ſay, <hi>Come, I will fetch Wine,</hi>

               <hi>and we will fill our ſelves with ſtrong Drink; to morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more abundant.</hi> For <hi>We know not what a day may bring forth.</hi> I am ſure that very Night, a Hand wrote ſomething on the Wall, that daſht all <hi>Belſhazzar's</hi> Jollity, and made an end of his Mirth and Monarchy together.

            <p n="2">2. Labour to <hi>ſee an end of all perfection;</hi> that ſo thence thou mayſt learn a ſanctified Moderation in the enjoying, and patient Contentedneſs in looſing any, or all of them: And here truly, we may admire God's Wiſdom and Mercy towards us, in ſo Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it, that theſe <hi>Perfections</hi> will not laſt, or help always: For if they could, ſuch is the Atheiſm of our Hearts, that we ſhould make <hi>Fleſh our Arm;</hi> be ſo glued to theſe lower Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, as we ſhould never look after more divine Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But now that the <hi>Faſhion of this World paſſeth away,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 29, 30, 31. we are now to learn another Leſſon, <hi>to rejoyce as though we rejoyced not,</hi> and, <hi>to uſe this World, as though we uſed it not;</hi> to ſit looſe in our Affections from theſe outward things, that ſit ſo looſe from us. And therefore let not our Affections be more conſtant than the things, and if they be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, let not our deſires after them be infinite; let's not <hi>hold faſt Spiders webs,</hi> Job 8. 14, 15.

            <p>I added a <hi>contented Patience</hi> in their Loſs: For in this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Stoicks</hi> Rule is good, Always to conſider what thou admireſt and loveſt, <gap reason="foreign">

But if it be a Wife, a Child, a Friend, think what they are, and that thou canſt not loſe more in their loſs, than they come to, and that is but a mortal Creature. Hence on the contrary it was that <hi>Micah's Mother</hi> did ſo fret and <hi>curſe,</hi> when ſhe loſt her Silver, <hi>Judg.</hi> 17. 2.

            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="3">3. Labour to <hi>ſee an end of all theſe Perfections,</hi> that thou mayſt thereby be ſtirred up, to do as much good with them, as thou canſt, whilſt they laſt; for we ſee, if we do not ſpend them, they will ſpend of themſelves.</p>
            <p>And therefore it would be our Wiſdom to <hi>take them in ſeaſon,</hi> and to put them over to God, who uſeth to reſtore them to us in a better kind.

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. And that's the laſt particular.

<pb n="409" facs="tcp:56446:154"/> Now if you ſhould ask, Where that's to be found? The Text makes anſwer, <hi>But thy Commandment is exceeding broad.</hi> God's Word is the <hi>Field,</hi> in which this <hi>Pearl</hi> is found, which will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for all Times, and fully comfort thee in thy greateſt Wants. He is never very <hi>Poor,</hi> in whom <hi>the Word of God dwells richly.</hi> But of this in the ſecond part of the Text. For the preſent, that <hi>Perfection,</hi> which we ſhall find in it, and which will <hi>perfectly</hi> and everlaſtingly make us happy, is (as they uſe to diſtinguiſh it) either Objective, or Formal.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Objective Perfection is God and Chriſt, whoſe Nature and <hi>Work is perfect,</hi> Deut. 32. 4. to whom nothing is wanting, and therefore <hi>fully Perfect,</hi> and from whom all the Perfection of the Creature is derived, and in whom it is <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, Infinitely,</hi> and therefore <hi>Eternally perfect. Jeſus Chriſt the ſame yeſterday, and to day and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13. 8. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed may well be called <hi>the End of all perfection;</hi> as you heard, that many Expounded thoſe words of him. He is that Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, on which, I told you, St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> placed <hi>David,</hi> when he ſpake theſe words, <hi>Chriſtus mons eſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Mountain,</hi> from which only we may with <hi>David</hi> here deſcry <hi>the end of all</hi> other <hi>Perfections;</hi> for thou wilt never ſee an <hi>Emptineſs</hi> in <hi>them,</hi> till thou haſt found a <hi>Fulneſs,</hi> and All-ſufficiency in <hi>Him. To</hi> this <hi>Hill</hi> therefore let us <hi>lift up</hi> our Hearts <hi>and Eyes, from whence comes our Help,</hi> our full, our everlaſting Salvation. And ſeeing it's <hi>the Perfection of all things,</hi> that are ordained to a further end, when they are brought to the Fruition of it, <hi>Noli hoerere in via, &amp; non pervenire ad finem,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks, Stay not below in theſe inferiour and worſe Perfections. Reſt not till thou beeſt made partaker of Chriſt. And further, when (as the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher tells us, that) <hi>Finis quaeritur in infinitum, media vero cum modo;</hi> let our Affections towards this <hi>End of Perfection,</hi> be conſtant and enlarged, as much as we can; if we could, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly. But ſeeing other <hi>perfections</hi> that have an <hi>end,</hi> are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Hindrances,</hi> at the beſt but <hi>Helps;</hi> and it's a part of our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection that we ſtand ſo much in need of them, let not our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires be terminated in them. But whether with them, or without them, let us make ſure of Chriſt, who <hi>hath an unchangeable Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> and therefore is able to ſave us, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="410" facs="tcp:56446:155"/> ſo ſupplies what we have ſeen other Perfections wanted, which did not always laſt, and therefore did not <hi>ſave always,</hi> and did not reach to our greateſt Wants, and therefore could not <hi>ſave to the uttermoſt.</hi> But Chriſt doth both. And therefore, to this purpoſe, what <hi>David</hi> ſaid of the Bleſſed Man, the Father ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth to our Bleſſed Saviour, that he is <hi>the Tree planted by the Waters ſide.</hi> The <hi>Waters flow,</hi> but this Tree is <hi>rooted</hi> ſure, on which if thou layeſt ſure hold, thou art out of danger of drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And therefore let me ſpeak to thee in his words, <hi>Raperis in praeceps? Tene lignum. Voluit te amor Mundi? Tene Chriſtum.</hi> Lay ſtrong hold on Chriſt, and thou ſhalt have <hi>ſtrong Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> for he is <hi>a Prieſt for ever.</hi> And ſo no end that way: And for the other, whatever others tell us, what a ductile nature Gold is of, and how much Ground an ounce of it may be made to cover; yet we, <hi>that are bought with no ſuch corruptible things as Silver and Gold,</hi> muſt believe that one drop of our dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saviours Blood can and will cover, and purge all ours and all Believers Souls: And ſo it, as well as the Word, is <hi>exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broad.</hi> And that's the <hi>Objective Perfection</hi> we muſt aim at. The <hi>Formal</hi> is double, Grace, and Glory.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For Grace: It's that, which ſets the Soul in joynt again, and ſo <hi>makes the Man of God perfect;</hi> and being once ſavingly wrought is ſo firmly eſtabliſhed, that all the Popiſh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian ſubtilties, or the <hi>Gates of Hell,</hi> ſhall never prevail againſt it. And therefore it would be well, if we were ſo wiſe as to reach out for this <hi>Perfection;</hi> and to know at laſt, whatever <hi>perfection</hi> we may conceive to be in ſinful Courſes, yet that, in truth, it's Sin only that daſheth all our <hi>Perfection: Thou waſt perfect in thy way, till Iniquity was found in thee,</hi> Ezek. 28. 15. And for it ſelf, that how ever it may pleaſe for the preſent, and promiſe more for the <hi>future,</hi> yet we ſhall find them to be <hi>deceitful Luſts;</hi> that they deprive us of endleſs Happineſs for the enjoyment of ſhort and empty Contentments; that there will be a Time, when we ſhall hear, as in the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 13. <hi>Thine end is come,</hi> and <hi>the meaſure of thy Covetouſneſs:</hi> The ſame we may ſay of other ſins, there will one day be <hi>an end of all,</hi> and that none of the beſt; for <hi>the end of thoſe things is Death,</hi> Rom. 6. 21. And though, I confeſs, ſin and the puniſhment of it will never have end; and that's the ſinners woe, becauſe they are <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta ad damnationem, non firmamenta ad ſalutem:</hi> Yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of ſin is ſoon over, and ends the ſooner, that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:56446:155" rendition="simple:additions"/> thereof may laſt for ever. Otherwiſe in Grace, which as it is that heavenly <hi>Panoply</hi> of Breadth and Extent ſufficient to cover the whole Man; there being no want, but ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Grace or other, can make a Supply: So for Continuance, it reſembles the Eternal Fountain from which it ſprings, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſaith S. <hi>Chryſoſtom, Love never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 8. <hi>The Fear of the Lord endureth for ever,</hi> Pſal. 19. 9. This is <hi>that Way everlaſting,</hi> Pſal. 139. 24. Which either hath no end, or a very happy one. Rom. 6. 22. <hi>You have your fruit unto Holineſs, and the end everlaſting Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, And that's the laſt <hi>Pefection,</hi> which is as Immortal as thy Soul, and as Large as thine Appetite: When the <hi>Sun ſhall no more go down, neither the Moon with draw her Light, but the Lord ſhall be thine everlaſting Light: And the days of thy Mourning ſhall be ended,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaketh. This <hi>Perfection,</hi> I confeſs, is not here to be attained to. <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledged himſelf <hi>not to be already perfect,</hi> Phil. 3. 12. But yet it's good now to prepare our ſelves for it, and to make ſure of it; that when Death and Judgment ſhall come, and we ſtripped naked of all theſe fading Perfections, may not then be found altogether <hi>naked,</hi> but be <hi>Cloathed upon with our Houſe from God,</hi> Eternal in the Heavens: That ſo, when many a wicked Man, that <hi>had his good things in this Life,</hi> will be conſtrained to ſay, I was, indeed, once rich, and honourable, and happy, as I my ſelf thought, and others took me. I <hi>was,</hi> as that perhaps was the Cauſe of my preſent Miſery, and the very thought of it now augments it. I had Wiſdom, and Beauty, and Strength, and the reſt; but now I ſee a woful <hi>end</hi> of all ſuch <hi>Perfections:</hi> We on the contrary to our eternal Comfort, may ſay, ſomething we have loſt (though indeed no loſers) we were ſinful and miſerable, but now we <hi>ſee an end of all</hi> that with Comfort: But withal ſomething we had, which we yet have and ſhall for ever. We were holy, and humble, and thankful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo we are now, and ſo ſhall remain to all Eternity, <hi>never to ſee an end of this Perfection</hi> And therefore to conclude all in a word; Let us all ſo labour, with <hi>David</hi> here, to ſee <hi>and end of all theſe Perfections,</hi> that we may have that begun here, which we may have at that day fully <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,</hi> but never <hi>ended.</hi>

            <p>IN this Verſe we have the exceeding Perfection of God's Word ſet out, by comparing it with the fading Shortneſs and narrow Scantneſs of all other outward <hi>Perfections.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the firſt, What's meant by <hi>Commandment:</hi> You muſt remember, that God's Word in this <hi>Pſalm</hi> (in which the Pſalmiſt intended to ſet out the Glory of it to the full) is called by diverſe Names; all which in themſelves have their diſtinct <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>The diſtinct Opening of every which word would now be too long; and though uſeful even to you, yet ſo as would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Speech about that, which, at leaſt at this time, may be more ſeaſonable. It will be ſufficient for our preſent Satisfaction that moſt agree, that all theſe Words in the main ſignifie the ſame thing, namely, the Word of God in the Extent of it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commands, or Promiſes, or Threats: And ſo in this Text, though called by the Name of a <hi>Commandment,</hi> yet he means the
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:56446:156"/> whole word, or any part of it; whether a Commandment, as the word here uſed properly ſignifieth, or a Threat, or a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, for both are Virtual Commands: God's Threats virtually command us to Fear, and his Promiſes virtually command us to Believe. And ſo God's Word, his Commandments, his Threats (eſpecially in reference to the Pſalmiſts preſent Meaning and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion) his <hi>Promiſes</hi> are <hi>exceeding broad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What's then meant by this exceeding Breadth? What we tranſlate <hi>exceeding broad,</hi> the Vulgar and the Antients according to their uſual Tranſlation of this word, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>, there, and that for ever; a moſt ſtrong and full Expreſſion, that, whereas if a Man look to theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Contentments, there's nothing ſettled, or if ſettled, yet it's but poorly, not <hi>for ever,</hi> according to that as ſtrong Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Pſal. 39. 5. <hi>Verily every Man at his beſt eſtate, is altogether vanity;</hi> or, as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is, <hi>all Men are all vanity,</hi> even <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> (the ſame word in both places) when moſt <hi>ſettled</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> yet he continues not ſo long: But when full of <hi>Riches,</hi> and happy in <hi>Children,</hi> and ſo in a ſeeming ſettledneſs, yet it's ſoon ſhaken.</p>
            <pb n="416" facs="tcp:56446:158"/>
            <p> Nay, further, whereas if a Man ſhould look at God's <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Promiſe,</hi> as it is <hi>in our unſettled hearts,</hi> we are ready to think that it's as ready to waver as our Hearts are; as the ſhadow of the Sun or Moon in the Water ſeems to ſhake as much as the Water doth which it ſhines in.</p>
            <p>Yet for all this ſeeming ſhaking here below, the Sun and Moon go on in a ſtedfaſt Courſe in Heaven. So the Pſalmiſt tells us, that however our Hearts <hi>ſtagger</hi> at a <hi>Promiſe through unbelief;</hi> nay, and our Unbelief makes us believe, that the Promiſe often is ſhaken withal, and when we are at our Wits-end, we are ready to think that God's Promiſe comes to an end too, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 8. Yet God's <hi>Word is ſettled,</hi> though not in our <hi>Hearts,</hi> yet in <hi>Heaven;</hi> yea, and there <hi>for ever,</hi> as ſettled as Heaven it ſelf is; yea, more than ſo, for <hi>Heaven and Earth may paſs,</hi> but <hi>not one jot</hi> or <hi>tittle of the Law</hi> (and therefore of the Goſpel) <hi>ſhall fail,</hi> Luke 16. 17.</p>
            <p>And thus we ſee, that God's <hi>Commandment</hi> and <hi>Promiſe,</hi> in this reſpect, is <hi>Exceeding broad,</hi> reaching to all Times. Was a word of Command <hi>the Guide of thy youth?</hi> I aſſure thee, it will be as good a <hi>Staff of thine age.</hi> And I aſſure you, a good Promiſe is a good Nurſe, both to the young Babe, and decrepit old Man. Your <hi>Apothecaries</hi> beſt Cordials in time will loſe their Spirits, and ſometimes the ſtronger they are, the ſooner. But hath a Promiſe cheared thee ſay, twenty, thirty, forty years ago? Taſte it but now afreſh, and thou ſhalt find it as freſh, and give thee as much Refreſhment as ever. If it hath been thy greateſt Joy in thy joyful Youth, I tell thee, it hath as much Joy in it for thy ſad Old-age. That may be ſaid of God's Word, which the Prophet ſaith of God himſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46. 4. <hi>And even to Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age I am he, and even to hoare hairs I will carry you.</hi> Doth not the Pſalmiſt ſay as much in the 160. Verſe of this Pſalm, <hi>Thy Word is true from the Beginning.</hi> It's well, it begins well. But will it laſt as well? Yes: He adds, <hi>And every one of thy righteous Judgments endureth for ever.</hi> Anſwerable to which, is that other Expreſſion, <hi>ver.</hi> 152. <hi>Concerning thy Teſtimonies, I have known of old, that thou haſt founded them for ever.

Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, get acquainted with God's Word and Promiſe as ſoon as you can, and maintain that Acquaintance everlaſtingly; and your knowledg of it ſhall not either go before, or go beyond its Truth.

            </p>
            <p>And ſo I have done with the Firſt <hi>Breadth</hi> of God's Word, reaching to all Times.</p>
            <p n="2">II.

               </gap> they muſt grow too, as their Children did, or elſe they would not ſerve their turn. So truly here, a gracious Promiſe will be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a good Garment, that will keep a poor Soul warm at heart Forty years together, and much longer than ſo. And which is the beſt of all, we cannot out-grow it. It will ſerve to lap the tender Babe in, and yet not leave the talleſt Chriſtian in any place bare, if he will but wear it. This is the Second <hi>Breadth.</hi> It will reach to all Needs and Wants; which may be further conſidered in two Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some Word and Promiſe of God, or other, is able to reach to all our outward Wants and Evils, which no one outward Contentment can do. Health only cures Sickneſs, but as many a Man is healthful and poor together, it reacheth not to cure his Poverty: And Riches take away Poverty, but cannot ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times buy Health. Honour perſumes a Man, and keeps him from ſtinking in <hi>Man's noſtrils;</hi> but many a Man that is well eſteemed of, may be poor enough. One Contentment helps uſually but one Want, and one Plaiſter uſeth not to cover many Sores; and truly for outward Matters, ſcarce any Man hath a Plaſter for every Sore: Say thoſe of you that have moſt in this kind, Have you ſo much as you want nothing? Now truly, herein eſpecially is ſeen the <hi>Exceeding breadth</hi> of God's Word and Promiſes. Had we but ſo much Skill as to go to every Box of precious Oyntment in this Myrotheke, we might find cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a Salve for every outward Sore: And had we but ſo much Faith but as to apply it, we ſhould find it ſovereign too. Here's a Promiſe that might heal that Wound, which a ſlanderous Tongue hath given me; there another, which might be my beſt Cordial on my Sick-bed; in another the poor Hunger-ſtarved
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:56446:159"/> Body might theſe hard Times meet with a good Meals-meat, yea, I aſſure you, and Dainties too. I name not more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, nor have I time to exemplifie any. But in general, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider only the 92. <hi>ver.</hi> of this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and think whether it ſpeak not one word for all: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs thy Law had been my delights, I had periſhed in mine Affliction.</hi> Affliction is a large word, and may contain under it many particular Evils: Now where's his Cure for all?

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. We read it, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs it had been my delight:</hi> But the word in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal is wonderfully ſignificant in a double reſpect; its both. 1. <hi>In numero plurali.</hi> 2. <hi>Forma duplicata:</hi> In plural number <hi>Delights,</hi> and they doubled too. Is my Affliction ſickneſs? In God's Word, had I but Faith, I might get Health and Health again. Is it Nakedneſs? I might get Clothes, yea, and <hi>double Clothing:</hi> And ſo of the reſt. Brethren, did we but walk ſo in Obedience to the Word, that we were fit for Mercies, and then had but Faith to rely upon the Promiſe for them; in this <hi>one Bible</hi> we might find <hi>many Delights,</hi> and them doubled too. Health and Health by the Word, is double Health; Food and Food with and from a Promiſe, is double Food, both firſt and ſecond Courſe too. So God's Word reacheth to all Wants of the outward Man, and in that reſpect is <hi>exceeding broad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, It can reach to cover all the Nakedneſs, and heal all the Wounds of the inward Man; and if ſo, then ſure it is <hi>exceeding, exceeding broad.</hi> In this reſpect, though a Man were ſo outwardly happy, that he were clothed and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed <hi>Cap-a-pe,</hi> as you ſay, from top to toe in regard of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man; yet for all this, as the Prophet ſpeaks in a like Caſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 20. This <hi>Covering</hi> may be <hi>narrower, than that a Man can wrap himſelf in it:</hi> Though harneſſed from top to toe in this kind, yet truly this is not Armour of Proof. Brethren, a Man may have a poor naked Soul under all our warm and gay Clothes, and truly the <hi>Arrow of God's Wrath</hi> can wound the Soul through all ſuch Clothes and Armour.</p>
            <p>O Bleſſed then be God, who hath given us his Word, which as it can clothe the Body, ſo it can Cover the Soul too, that cannot only keep off many a heavy Stroke from the outward Man, but can keep the Conſcience from many a deadly Wound; yea, and can heal thoſe which we had got, when careleſly we had not it
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:56446:159" rendition="simple:additions"/> about us. I, Brethren, herein is ſeen the infinite Breadth of God's Word, that one Promiſe of it can quiet, and heal, and refreſh a weary wounded Conſcience; which no finite Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not all the Creatures joyned together can. Well are thoſe two joyned together, <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul.</hi> You read it <hi>Converting</hi> in the Text, and in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <hi>Reſtoring:</hi> But the ſame Phraſe in the Original is uſed, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1. 16. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Did not a Promiſe reach to all Times, It might be that I might out-live a Promiſe, and ſo it fail me at the laſt in ſome <hi>needful time of trouble,</hi> when I ſtand moſt in need of it. Should
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:56446:160"/> it ſuſtain me all my <hi>Life-time,</hi> and but fail me at my Death, my comfort might die with my Life, and ſo I ſhould be but poorly furniſhed, when I fail in the end of my Journey.</p>
            <p>Or again, Did it cover my outward Man, and leave my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man bare, I ſhould be but poorly clothed: And though it provided well for my Soul, but took no proviſion for my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man, I ſhould not think my ſelf throughly furniſhed. Did it not reach to all my Needs and Wants, though it ſhould leave but one place bare, I might be as mortally wounded in it as in twenty. Should it arm me againſt Covetouſneſs, and I be ſtruck with the envenomed arrow of Pride; Should it fence me from Luke-warmneſs, and I yet be enflamed with Anger and Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, or the like; One wound if Deadly, may ſpeed me. If it ſhould help me in many reſpects, and not ſupply me in all, I ſhould not be ſo <hi>throughly furniſhed,</hi> as the Apoſtle there ſaith, the Word is <hi>able</hi> to do for me. And therefore that it might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its end, it is (in the ſecond place) that in both reſpects <hi>Gods Commandment</hi> is <hi>exceeding Broad.</hi>

               <hi>broad Commandment,</hi> as <hi>new Planters</hi> would at a huge broad <hi>Continent,</hi> which would require a great deal of both time and pains fully to diſcover it; I aſſure you Gods Word will.</p>
            <p>An Argument this is, which I ſhould think neceſſary to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large my ſelf in, were I in another place, where other Books (and it may be bad ones too) are more read and ſtudied, than the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I read of <hi>Caroloſtadius,</hi> that he was nine years a Doctor, before he had read the Scripture. I my ſelf have been preſent, <note place="margin">Anama in Antibarb.</note> when one anſwering his Act for the Degree next to a Doctor, could not find the Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians;</hi> and was fain to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the matter by ſaying it was not in his Book: And knew of another, that had been ſeven years almoſt in the Univerſity, and had not had all that while a Bible in his ſtudy; but he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward turned <hi>Papiſt;</hi> as indeed it well agrees with <hi>Popery,</hi> in which by their good wills, Scripture ſhould be laid aſide, and their <hi>Schoolmen</hi> and Decretals only ſtudied. A Popiſh frame it is, to which I wiſh we even in this particular were not too much warping. <hi>Papiſts</hi> care not for Scripture; and Familiſts make <hi>Scripture-Learned</hi> as a term of Reproach. But the <hi>Jews</hi> (ſome tell us) dividing their time into three parts, would ſpend <note place="margin">Druſius.</note> one of them in reading. And another ſaith, that they ſcarce read any other Book than the Scripture. I would not ſtraiten Chriſtians ſo in either kind; but truly I ſhould deſire you all to <note place="margin">Sands.</note>
               <pb n="423" facs="tcp:56446:161" rendition="simple:additions"/> inlarge your ſelves in reading and ſtudying this <hi>Commandment,</hi> which is ſo <hi>exceeding Broad.</hi> Sure in this broad Field you ſhould find ſomething worth getting.</p>
            <p>Oh then with other Books, Debt-Books, and Law-Books, and Phyſick-Books, and other good Books you are reading, let God's Book be one eſpecially. Be reading here, and gathering there; here this word of Direction, and there that promiſe for Comfort. And if only one Promiſe (as I have ſhewed) may be of ſo great and manifold uſe, what encouragement have we to gather, when there are ſo many? If that Field be worth going to, in which I may get but one ear of Corn to ſatisfie the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of my Soul; Oh then it is very good gleaning in a <hi>Boaz</hi> Field, where we may <hi>glean</hi> even <hi>among the Sheaves,</hi> and have <hi>whole handfuls let fall for us,</hi> Ruth 2, 15, 16. I mean in the Word of God, where we may not only pick by Corns, but gather by Handfuls, even get Bundles of Promiſes to lay up againſt an harder Time: and therefore (as poor Folks you know will) let us glean and gather hard, eſpecially ſeeing God hinders us not to <hi>glean among the Sheaves.</hi> As God ſaid to <hi>Abraham</hi> in regard of <hi>Canaan his Inheritance,</hi> Gen. 13. 17. <hi>Go walk up and down in the length and breadth of it:</hi> So we, that are <hi>Heirs of the Promiſes,</hi> let us walk up and down in <hi>the breadth of</hi> this goodly Inheritance of ours, of this <hi>exceeding broad Commandment.</hi> As it is Rich, ſo let it <hi>dwell in us richly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is the <hi>Commandment exceeding broad?</hi> then ſearch into it, as for <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>4</label> Knowledg, ſo for Practice. I beſeech you let us <hi>make room for</hi> it in our <hi>Hearts:</hi> for it comes with a breadth.</p>
            <p>In this broad Commandment much to be done, and more to <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive. </seg>1</label> be avoided. In it many particular Graces and Duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be looked to. And as our Saviour in a like caſe ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 23. ſo truly we ſhall not have gone over all this broad Field, <hi>till the Son of Man be come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's broad, and therefore not ſtraitned: the way is narrow at firſt <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive. </seg>2</label> entrance, but the Commandment is broad when once entred, that you may with enlarged Hearts walk in it. It was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, which our Saviour took up againſt the <hi>Jews, John</hi> 8. 37. that his Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> did not <hi>take place,</hi> or as the word is, could not <hi>find room</hi> there. Oh, Brethren, we have even <hi>ſtrait</hi> hearts, God knows, for this <hi>broad Commandment.</hi> But oh that we were enlarged! Are we ſtraitned? Sure it is not the Word's fault: It would <hi>enlarge</hi> us, did we but receive it, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:56446:162" rendition="simple:additions"/> in another caſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 12. We are <hi>ſtraitned in our own Bowels,</hi> in our own Hearts. The more the pity, and the more our loſs, that ſo much precious Liquour runs beſide. And let me add that alſo, and I pray you therefore take heed, and remember what hath been ſaid, that as the Command and Promiſe is broad, laſting to all Times, and (as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> expounds it) bringing the Obedient to eternal Life: ſo the Threat can reach as far to bring thee to endleſs Wo, if thou beeſt diſobedient. The Promiſe <hi>broad,</hi> reaching to, and ſupplying of all our Wants: And the Curſe can be as broad too, to croſs thee in all thy Contentments, to wound thee both in Body and Soul, in every Joynt of the one, and Faculty of the other. See <hi>Zech.</hi> 5. 2, 3. The <hi>flying roll</hi> of the <hi>Curſe</hi> was <hi>twenty Cubits long,</hi> and <hi>ten Cubits broad.</hi> Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God's Threat and Curſe is as broad as all the miſeries of this Life, nay, as broad as Hell. And therefore get not a <hi>broad Conſcience,</hi> but a <hi>broad enlarged Heart</hi> in love and obedience, to entertain this <hi>exceeding broad Commandment.</hi> Elſe, as the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers term extream Careleſneſs, it will be <hi>Lata negligentia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the next place, it's a word of both comfort and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>5</label> 
               <hi>in the end of all other Perfections,</hi> that God<hi>'s Commandment is exceeding broad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay, firſt, Comfort, that whereas all other imperfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments are but ſhort and narrow, if I have but my ſhare in God's <hi>Word and Promiſe,</hi> I have that, which in the loſs of all them will reach me comfort to all Times, and in all Wants. Truly, Brethren, all outward Contentments, be they never ſo glorious and comfortable, they will not laſt long, nor reach far; not longer than Life, not ſo far as Heaven, no not ſo far as mine inward Man. <hi>Babylon's</hi> broad Walls are thrown down, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 58. they are unſtedfaſt as Waters; and as it is ſaid in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, <hi>the face</hi> of ſuch Waters is ſoon <hi>ſtraitned.</hi> Fair large <note place="margin">Job 37. 10.</note> Eſtates ſoon brought into a narrow compaſs; great Families ſoon reduced to a ſmall number. To ſpeak to the preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, pretty little Children are like pretty little Books, in which a Parent ſometimes reads much that very well likes him: But it may be he cannot read long for tears, when the Book is taken away; and at beſt he cannot read much becauſe it is but a little one. But bleſſed be God, may a Child of God ſay, who is ſure that he hath part in God and his Promiſe, that I have another Book of a larger Volumn, of a far broader Page than all theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts come to. They are but <hi>narrow Rivers</hi> at the beſt,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:56446:162"/> and they ſoon <hi>dried</hi> up too: But God in his Word, in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, hath <hi>broad Rivers</hi> that you read of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 21. and they deep ones too, in which I may bathe, and not be ſtraitned, and out of which I may drink for ever, and yet they never dried up, but <hi>ſpring up to everlaſting life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a Chriſtian's comfort in ſuch caſes, and it ſhould be his direction too in them; that when he ſees an end come of this <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> and of that, to be ſtill thinking that there will at laſt come an <hi>end of all:</hi> and yet in the <hi>end of all</hi> even then to look unto this <hi>Commandment</hi> and word and promiſe of God, which the Text ſaith is ſo <hi>exceeding broad.</hi> As, Hath God ſtraitned me in my eſtate? Take that out of the <hi>breadth of Gods Word.</hi> Hath he taken this pretty little child, this pretty little book, out of my hand, that I cannot read in it as formerly? Truly let us get a better, a bigger, a broader book into our hands, God's book, and ſee what we can read there; if not enough to make a full ſupply of all ſuch wants, that whereas other men ſhuffle and ſhift, have this fetch and that reach, and (as they uſe to ſay) when the Lion's skin is not big enough to cover all, they ſew the Fox skin to it to make it broad enough, and yet all will not do, becauſe there will be <hi>an end of all perfection;</hi> a Chriſtian is (or at leaſt ſhould be) able out of God's Word and Promiſes, as out of a rich Treaſury, to make a ſupply of all ſuch wants. Here he gets a promiſe for himſelf, and there another for his friend. Here one for a live-dead parent, and there another for himſelf, though his child be dead. In a word, that's it I call for; as much as we are ſtraitned in outward comforts, let us labour to be ſo much enlarged in God: and as much as he takes from us of outward contentments, to get as much and more from him in this <hi>broad Commandment</hi> and large <hi>Promiſes,</hi> and then we ſhall be no loſers.</p>
            <p>This one word alſo, that Gods <hi>Commandment is exceeding broad,</hi> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>6</label> is ground of great comfort to other of God's children in other caſes, as much ſatisfying them in two main doubts they ſtick at.</p>

            <p>No nor ſo much inward gifts of Learning and ſuch like abilities, though ſuch poliſhing neceſſary to the Prieſt, yet it's not it, but <hi>Holineſs</hi> that's here ingraven in his <hi>Crown;</hi> Knowledge without Grace, Learning in the head, without <hi>Holineſs</hi> in <hi>the forehead</hi> is but like a precious ſtone in a Toad's head, or like flowers ſtuck about a dead body, which will not fully keep it from ſmelling, the leſs half by much of a Miniſter's accompliſhment.

            <p>1. The <hi>Poor,</hi> which often have but poor Help.

            <p>2. The <hi>Stranger.</hi> Alas, he is far from Home, and it may be farther from Friends, and yet God would not have him further for it from having Juſtice. <hi>Judg righteouſly between every Man and his Brother, and the Stranger alſo that is with him,</hi> Deut. 1. 16.

            <p>2. In the ſecond place we from a ſecond view of the words are to deſcry his Love by what this coſt him, an enduring of that himſelf, from which he freed us.

            </p>
            <p>And thus from the words, by what he is and hath done to us, we have ſeen his Alſufficiency, and by what it coſt him we have deſcried his Bounty and Love.</p>

Some may be a means of comfort and help from evils, but not from greateſt: Others from ſome of the greateſt, but not from all; or if from all, yet never fully, or not alwayes ſeaſonably. <hi>The Bed will be too ſhort,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 20. <hi>for a man to ſtretch</hi> his whole length on, and the <hi>Covering</hi> too <hi>ſcant</hi> to wrap himſelf all over round about with; when Lion and Fox-skin both ſewed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will not perfectly ſecure, the <hi>Lamb's bloud</hi> will. <hi>I have ſeen an end to all other perfections,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>but thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is exceeding broad,</hi> Pſal. 119. 96. and his promiſes in Chriſt as broad; in length reaching to all our times, and in breadth to cover all our wants, and therefore, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſweetly, <hi>in finem</hi>

So happy every way thou art, if thou haſt him: but more happy, if every way we could improve him: for, as God would have none of our parts and abilities lye idle; ſo neither would he have any thing in him, that we have intereſt in, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. And therefore ſeeing Chriſt and Godlineſs are <hi>profitable for all things,</hi> we ſhould in greater and leſſer wants and evils improve Chriſt and have recourſe to him, that even to us and in our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, whether inward or outward bluſterings and thirſtings and faintings we may find him as an <hi>hiding-place from the wind,</hi> and a <hi>covert from the ſtorm,</hi> that thy <hi>thirſty ſoul</hi> may find him <hi>rivers of waters</hi> in that dry place, and thy <hi>tired-out ſpirit, the ſhadow of a great rock in a weary land.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In which words two things are implied, and two things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned: The firſt thing implied in theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ſin no more,</hi> was, that after his recovery without better care taken he was in danger to ſin again. The ſecond, this; that, if he did revolt to his former ſin, he was in eminent danger to relapſe into a worſe malady, in theſe words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>leſt a worſe thing come unto thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="486" facs="tcp:56446:193"/>
            <p> Whereupon the two things preſcribed and injoyned (and the firſt a means of the ſecond) are, 1. A ſerious conſideration of the Mercy he had received in thoſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Behold, thou art made whole.</hi> 2. A ſtudious care that he would avoid the like ſin, if he would not incur a greater danger, in thoſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Sin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee.</hi> Like as the <hi>Angel</hi> charged <hi>Lot,</hi> now gotten out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> to flie <hi>for his life,</hi> and not <hi>look back,</hi> leſt Vengeance ſhould <hi>overtake</hi> him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 17. Or as if the Phyſician before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of ſhould ſay thus to his Patient, whoſe wantonneſs or other diſorder had brought him into ſome dangerous diſeaſe, which yet through his skill and care and pains were now cured: Friend, let this fair ſcape be a fair warning to you, that you never play the like wanton, leſt you come to be in a worſe caſe, and then meet not with ſo eaſie a Cure; but it may prove to be utterly incurable.</p>
            <p>The two things implied will afford two <hi>Obſervations;</hi> and the two other injoyned will fitly ſerve for a double <hi>Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the firſt Note from the firſt thing implied is this: That <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> after healing Mercy we are in great danger, without better care taken, to <hi>ſin again,</hi> as before, if not worſe than ever: For you may be aſſured that our Saviour's Caveat was no <hi>idle word. Sin no more</hi> to this recovered ſinner was a <hi>Watch word,</hi> that ſpake his danger of a new Surpriſe: An <hi>Item,</hi> that told him, that, if he looked not to it, he was likely to run into a further Arrear, even after his old <hi>Debt</hi> was paid, and he had a new Stock to ſet up with: And to this purpoſe obſerve in this Inſtance theſe three particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That Chriſt contents not himſelf with his firſt healing Viſit: But ſeeth that he had need of a ſecond meeting with, to prevent an after-clap. As the Apoſtles, whom they at firſt <hi>converted,</hi> they after <hi>viſited</hi> and <hi>confirmed,</hi> Acts 14. 21, 22. &amp; 15. 32. &amp; 36. 41.</p>
            <p>Secondly, And this after-meeting and ſecond doſe of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Phyſick he gave him <hi>in the Temple,</hi> though he were then (it's likely) in a good mind, and hopefully in a good way.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, And this <hi>Item</hi> and advice <hi>(ſin no more)</hi> beſet on both ſides with very forcible Arguments, to make it more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual. Before it you have <hi>Beneficium acceptum;</hi> he is put in mind of the Benefit received, to make his Ingenuity bluſh: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,</hi>
               <pb n="487" facs="tcp:56446:193"/> 
               <hi>thou art made whole, ſin no more.</hi> After it is ſet <hi>Futurum judicium,</hi> a worſe miſchief that's likely to follow upon his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond miſcarriage, that ſo he might tremble and <hi>fear, and do no more</hi> ſo preſumptuouſly. <hi>Sin not, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which three hold forth thus much to us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That after Chriſt hath in mercy <hi>viſited</hi> us, we have need that a ſecond time he ſhould <hi>meet</hi> with us. As <hi>Manoah</hi> after the firſt meſſage by the Angel, that he ſhould have a Child, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that he might come again the ſecond time, and tell them <hi>how they ſhould order it,</hi> Judg. 13. 8, 12. After we are raiſed up, and ſet on our Legs, we have need to be taught, how we ſhould walk to prevent an after-ſtumble, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 2. After a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, after a Cordial to recover from a former Qualm, an Antidote to fortifie us againſt an after-Poyſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And this before we diſtemper our ſelves after our Recovery, when in a moſt hopeful way to a perfect Cure. Chriſt after our moſt comfortable up-riſings need again viſit us further, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and direct us, though he find us in the <hi>Temple,</hi> though in never ſo good a temper and poſture.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And then he had need deal more ſeriouſly with us, as here, by repreſenting both the Mercies we have received, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of Judgments, which upon freſh miſcarriages we may fear, on every ſide to keep us in; and all this, becauſe (as we have it in the Doctrine) we are then very ſubject to break out: When God hath tied us with <hi>thickeſt Cords of Love,</hi> then moſt petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly to <hi>break aſunder all Bonds of</hi> Obedience. Thus not only <hi>Pharaoh</hi> upon every <hi>reſpite</hi> grows <hi>more hard;</hi> and <hi>Tyre</hi> after <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty years Captivity, returns to her former Hire,</hi> Iſa. 23. 17. as though they <hi>had been delivered</hi> only to <hi>do all abominations,</hi> Jer. 7. 10.

So ſecondly, as old ſins are uſually returned to, ſo oft-times new ones are <hi>de novo</hi> fallen into. <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> when newly put into their Office <hi>offer ſtrange fire,</hi> Lev. 10. 1. upon <hi>new Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies new ſins</hi> inſtead of <hi>new wayes.</hi> Iſrael, when but <hi>now</hi> delivered from <hi>Egypt,</hi> begins to <hi>worſhip ſtrange Gods, which their fathers knew not,</hi> Jer. 19. 4. <hi>new Gods,</hi> Judg. 5. 8.

Never are we more in danger of being foiled with a renewed charge or a new on-ſet, than when we are ready to cry <hi>Victoria.</hi> To prevent which, God's care of our ſafety is very obſervable in theſe two particulars in Scripture.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That when he intends a perfect Reſcue, to his <hi>delivering</hi> Mercy he joyns <hi>guiding</hi> Mercy; his preventing and following Grace keep company. <hi>Thy rigteouſneſs ſhall go before thee, and</hi>

                  <hi>As</hi> Hoſ. 2. 6, 7.</note> where there are many paths which may deceive him, he hath moſt need of a Guide: Nor have we more need of Deliverance from danger, when we are in it, than we have of Guidance, when got out of it, which God therefore in mercy grants, when he means to compleat his Mercy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And ſecondly therefore alſo is wont not to perfect a Mercy or
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:56446:195"/> Deliverance at the firſt, nor, it may be, at all in this life, but leaves a <hi>Canaanite,</hi> when <hi>Iſrael</hi> is in <hi>Canaan,</hi> an <hi>Hadad,</hi> a <hi>Rezon,</hi> and a <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> whilſt <hi>Solomon</hi> ſits <hi>peaceably</hi> on his <hi>Throne,</hi> to allay the heat of the Pot, which elſe would boyl over. Few ſuch <hi>Mornings</hi> like that 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 4. in which there is <hi>no Cloud,</hi> or if ſo in the morning, yet not uſually ſo all the day, to keep us the better in, who elſe would be running out, and playing the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons in the Sunſhine. Chriſt was never <hi>loſt</hi> but once in the <hi>Crowd, Luke</hi> 2. 43. Nor God ever ſo often as in the crowds of his Mercy: and therefore ſomthing we ſhall have, that we do not pine, and yet not all that we would have, that we do not ſurfeit: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he gives to incourage, but ſtill ſomthing he withholds, the better to nurture us, and to force us ſtill to wait upon him; who elſe (like ill-nurtured children when they have got all they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire) ſhould be then moſt like to run away fartheſt from him; ſome Worm in our faireſt Apple, and ſome Blemiſh in our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Beauty, ſome bitter in our greateſt ſweet, to make all medicinal. In our greateſt enjoyments ſomthing ſhall be wanting, or croſs to our deſires, which may be as a conſtant <hi>Memento,</hi> and really ſay, <hi>ſin no more,</hi> becauſe elſe we ſhall be then <hi>ready to ſin more than ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, firſt, it is not in the nature or power of Affliction (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> ſanctified) to mortify Corruption, that, as ſoon as we are freed from the one, we ſhould be rid of the other. The Winter-froſt may nip the Weeds, and keep them under ground; but yet ſo, as that they ſprout out again the next ſpring. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of a <hi>Fool in the Mortar,</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> of <hi>Droſs in the Furnace.</hi> This Cripple in the Text, though after <hi>thirty eight years</hi> weakneſs he had been healed by Chriſt, did not yet know Chriſt at the firſt; and ſome may never; and then no wonder, if, notwithſtanding all, they prove never the <hi>better,</hi> but much the <hi>worſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. For that Corruption, which Affliction doth not <hi>heal,</hi> it doth at moſt but <hi>curb,</hi> and when that <hi>Curb</hi> in a Deliverance is removed, the Corruption is the more fully and violently manifeſted and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted; as Antichriſt, when the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>dan,</hi> when the <hi>Preiſt's feet were once out of it,</hi> (and ſo that Dam as it were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down) runs down his Channel more violently than before. In times of danger and trouble Conſcience often proves a Shrew, and will chide, and God's angry, and we fear will ſtrike. <hi>The Angel ſtands in the way with a drawn Sword to ſtop us:</hi> and when
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:56446:195" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>ſeen</hi> will make a <hi>Balaam ſtand ſtill.</hi> Thus then theſe pricking <hi>Thorns hedge</hi> up <hi>the way,</hi> and a ſtormy day ſhuts the door, and keeps us in: but the next fair blaſt that opens it, makes the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton run out with the more eagerneſs. As the hunger-ſtarved Man with his food, the longer he was before kept from it, the more greedily he now falls to it; as much as he pined before, he ſurfeits now: as they are wont to ſay of Sailers, that they are not more <hi>calm</hi> in a <hi>Storm,</hi> than they <hi>ſtorm</hi> in a <hi>Calm,</hi> or when got to Shore.</p>
            <p>3. As in this caſe the Affliction was but a <hi>Curb;</hi> ſo the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance and Mercy proves a <hi>Snare,</hi> adds Fewel to that Flame, which the former rainy day quenched, or at leaſt kept down, ſtrengthen's the recovered man's Luſt, which Sickneſs weakned, affords matter for the rich man's Pride, which his Poverty hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, entertains the Wanton and Worlding with other company, whom Straits and Dangers for that time inforced to ſeek after God, and made him glad of his acquaintance. As in Bloud-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, upon the return of the Bloud we are then moſt ready to faint; I wiſh that after our Bloud-ſhed, upon the return of Mercies our former Reformation, that ſeemed to have ſome life in it, do not quite dy away, and that <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> do not continue <hi>Brothers</hi> ſtill; the one's Name ſignifieth Plenty or <hi>Fruitfulneſs,</hi> and the other's <hi>Forgetfulneſs;</hi> that in the plenty of reſtored Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies we did not forget our Miſery, and our ſelves and our God altogether. The Lord make good that Promiſe <hi>Job</hi> 5. 24. to us, that when being kept long from home, we may <hi>viſit our Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, and not ſin;</hi> to which we are very ſubject. The ſick man hath not need of more care and warineſs in the depth of his ſickneſs, than of a fair and ſafe up-riſing out of his ſick-bed upon his recovery; as nothing more eaſie in that caſe, than to fall into a Relapſe, ſo nothing is more dangerous. Nothing more eaſie; There you have this firſt point, that after healing Mercy we are ſubject to return to our former Sins. And in that I ſaid, <hi>nothing more dangerous,</hi> we have the ſecond.</p>
            <p>That, if upon ſuch Deliverance we do fall back into Sin, we ſhall <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> be in great danger, that ſome greater Miſchief will befall us. <hi>Sin no more,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>leſt a worſe thing come unto thee:</hi> he ſaith <hi>leſt</hi> it do, but he thereby implyes, and it is his meaning, if thou doeſt, for certain it will. A Relapſe into a bodily Diſeaſe after a Recovery uſeth not to be more dangerous, than a Backſliding into Sin after a Deliverance oft proves deſperate. <hi>After all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and ſeeing that thou our God haſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed</hi>
               <pb n="492" facs="tcp:56446:196"/> 
               <hi>us leſs than our iniquities deſerve, and haſt given us ſuch a deliverance as this; ſhould we again break thy Commandments? wouldſt thou not be angry with us, till thou hadſt conſumed us, ſo that there ſhould be no remnant nor eſcaping?</hi> ſaith <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 13, 14. As if he had ſaid, if after ſuch miſery to drive us, and ſuch mercy to draw us, we break now with God, <hi>Actum, conclamatum eſt,</hi> we are broken wholly and irrecoverably: the Houſe ſo on fire, that it cannot be ſaved, the Conſumption ſo far gone that it cannot be cured. It's the breaking of the Bone, that was newly ſet after a former breaking, and that's more dangerous; a new Wound in an old one, and that's hardly cured; like that <hi>Plague of Leproſie broken out of the Boyl,</hi> which made the Perſon wholly <hi>unclean</hi> in the Law, <hi>Lev.</hi> 13. 20. Or like the Man in the Goſpel, into whom the <hi>unclean ſpirit</hi> after diſpoſſeſſion maketh re-entry with ſeven <hi>other ſpirits worſe than himſelf;</hi> and ſo his laſt ſtate proves worſe than the firſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 45. and that place ſpeaks us every way worſe, if we prove not better, after we have been ſo well dealt with. <hi>Worſe</hi> in point of <hi>puniſhment;</hi> and that, becauſe <hi>worſe</hi> in point of <hi>ſin.</hi>

            <p>There's more to be aſhamed of, than to be rejoyced in, and the greater the occaſion was of joy, the more matter there is of ſhame and grief.

<pb n="495" facs="tcp:56446:197"/> what we have ſuffered be enough, that ſo he might inflict no more, which he earneſtly deſires and waits for, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 4. But if our diſtempers and out-rages after all this ſay no; if not yet <hi>ready for the ſodering,</hi> look for no <hi>faſtning,</hi> Iſa. 41. 7. if not yet kindly <hi>melted,</hi> and <hi>Droſs</hi> removed, we muſt into the <hi>Furnace</hi> again, and it <hi>made ſeven times hotter.</hi> The Phyſician, after ſome <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Medicines adminiſtred, gives over a little, and ſtayes to ſee, whether the <hi>peccant Humour</hi> be ſufficiently <hi>evacuated:</hi> if no, but it's in a <hi>burry</hi> ſtill, he muſt give more, and then ſtronger. Theſe <hi>lucida intervalla</hi> are but Truces, (not a full Peace) which may break out into a more bloudy War, for which in this interim in that caſe he is preparing; but an intermiſſion of the fit of the Fever, which will return with greater violence, as it was with <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> intervals, but ſtill ſucceeded with heavier and heavier Judgments, which at laſt ended in his utter Deſtruction; the <hi>Clouds returning after Rain;</hi> as the <hi>King of Syria</hi> in <hi>the end of the year</hi> with a greater Force, and God, all the while that he forbears ſtriking, only lifting up his Hand higher to give the heavier and deadlier Stroke. Now with what bended knees, and with what trembling hearts and hands need we receive the returns of Mercies from that God, who is <hi>glorious in Holineſs,</hi> and <hi>fearful in Praiſes;</hi> whoſe begun Mercies, if abuſed, are but the beginnings of heavieſt Judgments, which is this <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="5">5. And yet the laſt and worſt of all is, that as abuſe of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies brings heavieſt Judgments, ſo to make them more deſperate, it deprives us of the beſt help for removing them, ſo that we are in danger to ſink irrecoverably under them, namely in that it ſtops both <hi>our mouths,</hi> that we cannot pray, and God's <hi>ear,</hi> that <hi>he will not hear,</hi> and both held out in that place of <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. when <hi>after</hi> their Captivity and <hi>deliverance</hi> from it they <hi>again break God's Commandments.

               <hi>he had done,</hi> and we have ill requited, than to grant us what we then never ſo mournfully ſue for, as he did in the like caſe to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Judg. 10. 10, to 15. I have again and again <hi>delivered</hi> you, and you have ſtill <hi>forſaken me</hi> and <hi>ſerved other Gods, I will therefore deliver you no more: Go and cry unto the gods that ye have choſen, and let them deliver you in your tribulation.</hi> Never expect God in after-ſtraits either at all, or at leaſt not ſo readily as in former troubles, to hear us, if we deal <hi>frowardly</hi> and falſly with him after that he hath had mercy on us. <hi>Wouldſt thou not be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with us till thou hadſt conſumed us, ſo that there ſhould be no remnant nor eſcaping?</hi> is all that <hi>Ezra</hi> can expect from a God ſo abuſed and provoked.

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It proves ſo in the Conſequents of it: they uſually growing the worſt of men, who grow worſe after beſt of Mercies, even moſt unprofitable and abominable, whom neither Afflictions, nor deliverances can work upon: as that's a rotten tooth, that can neither endure cold water, nor hot: and what you cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve either in Brine or Sugar will be ſure to corrupt and putrify.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nay it is ſo in the cauſe of it; two of the worſt of ſins being the chief ingredients into it, <hi>viz.</hi> Abominable Ingratitude, and Invincible Obſtinacy.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

And even in the deareſt of God's children God ſo ill takes it, that if the moſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>Hezekiah</hi> make ſuch returns, he ſhall ſmart for it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 25. compared with 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 17, 18.

            <p n="2">2. Moſt deſperate Obſtinacy, as ſtanding out againſt God when he hath gone through a full courſe of all means, of the very laſt and moſt likely, and which uſually are wont to be moſt effectual: for when God hath delivered his people from ſtraits, he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to faſten on them all obligations to obedience: beſides the tye of the Word in his Command there hath been the bond of affliction in their by-paſt miſery, and the <hi>thick cord</hi> of love in their preſent deliverance: and ſhall this <hi>three-fold cord</hi> be ſo eaſily broken? It's not the Heroick <hi>Impetus</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God <hi>coming</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Judg. 15. 14. Matth. 8 28. with Mark 5. 3, 4.</note> upon us, as ſometimes upon <hi>Sampſon,</hi> but from the inſult of ſome <hi>evil ſpirit</hi> more <hi>fierce</hi> than ordinarily, as in the Goſpel, that none of all, not all theſe <hi>chains and fetters can hold us,</hi> nor any thing <hi>tame</hi> us; a tough bad humour which ſtrongeſt Phyſick cannot purge, and which is the Phyſicians, laſt receipt, for ſuch are Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Mercies.</p>
            <p>Sometimes indeed afflictions are the laſt; as pinching and pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Poverty at laſt brought home the Prodigal, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. As a Winter-froſt helps to kill theſe Weeds, which in Summer ſprung up and multiplied. When <hi>Lenitives</hi> will not do, <hi>corroſives,</hi> ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, cuttings off ſometimes work the Cure. But what hope, if after all the Gangrene creep on ſtill?</p>
            <p>It may be you will ſay, ſometimes that may be preſerved in Sugar, that will not in Brine, and when God hath not been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the <hi>Wind</hi> and <hi>Earthquake,</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> he may be after, in <hi>the ſtill voice,</hi> 1 King. 19. 11, 12, 13. And therefore God, that he may leave no means uneſſayed, like a careful tender-hearted Father to a ſtubborn Child, whom he would not loſe, will try whether mildneſs, as a Summer-Sun, will not melt that heart, which harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as a winter froſt, hardned. You are told of a ſtone that will move at the gentle touch of a finger more than with the violent ruſh of your whole body: and ſuch ſtones ſometimes are our hard hearts; and therefore God, that <hi>delights not in the death of a ſinner,</hi> and with the goodneſs of whoſe Nature this ſweet way of Mercy moſt agrees, is willing, as at firſt, to begin with it; ſo, after other ſharper means uſed, at laſt to end with it. When after the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> want of Food, he in Mercy gave them Bread from Heaven, he ſaith, it was that he <hi>might prove them,</hi> whether they would <hi>walk</hi>
               <pb n="498" facs="tcp:56446:199"/> 
               <hi>in his Law, or no,</hi> Exod. 16. 4. So that, if after Judgments we have a return of Mercies, we had need take heed, for it may be then we go upon our laſt and ſtrongeſt trial. In Afflictions God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſtrongly tryeth us, whether we will cleave to him in want of Mercies; but by Mercies he maketh fulleſt tryal of us, whether we will ſerve and obey him, whether we will ſet upon our Journey for Heaven in ſuch fair Way and Weather, when we have nothing to hinder us; and whether we will build, when the Scaffold is built, and all Tools and Materials ready, that we want nothing that might help us. And then, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. if after all Mercies, yet <hi>ſour Grapes,</hi> what can God do more, but quite extirpate? If after tryal thus made of all means, of the laſt and beſt, we continue as ill or prove worſe than before, then, <hi>Reprobate ſilver call them,</hi> for <hi>the Lord hath rejected them,</hi> Jer. 6. 29, 30. <hi>Meneh, Meneh, Tekel</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Dan. 5. 25, to 30.</note>

            <p>THe Text is a Concluſion ſtrongly inferred upon two great Truths premiſed in the foregoing part of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> (ſummed up <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3. 10, 11. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 12, 13.)</p>
            <p>The firſt was that notwithſtanding all the evils that the godly endure; yet <hi>God is good to Iſrael,</hi> verſ. 1. and therefore it's <hi>good to draw near to God.</hi> It's <hi>good to draw near to a good God,</hi> nay beſt of all (as the <hi>Arabick</hi> reads it) to <hi>keep cloſe</hi> to that God, who is ſo good notwithſtanding the worſt evils.</p>
            <p>The ſecond was that notwithſtanding the wicked's preſent flouriſh, yet their <hi>end</hi> is <hi>deſtruction,</hi> verſ. 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in the Verſe immediatly before the Text, <hi>For lo, they that are far from thee ſhall periſh; thou haſt deſtroyed all them that go a whoring from thee;</hi> and therefore again it's <hi>good for me to draw near to thee. Bernard</hi> ſums up both in his double <hi>Quere, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi enim benè erit</hi>

               <hi>ſine illo? aut ubi malè poteſt eſſe cum illo?</hi> If it cannot be ill with him, nor well without him, then it's beſt to <hi>draw near to him.</hi> If it be no leſs than <hi>deſtruction</hi> to <hi>go a whoring from him,</hi> then the Spouſe, that in running away after <hi>her lovers</hi> hath met with a <hi>ſharp Thorn-Hedge,</hi> had need <hi>return home to her firſt Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> Hoſ. 2. 6, 7. If they <hi>periſh</hi> that are <hi>afar off,</hi> then it is my ſafeſt courſe to <hi>get</hi> and <hi>keep near.</hi> When they of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s ſervants, that were in <hi>the field,</hi> were <hi>ſmitten</hi> with the <hi>hail,</hi> it concerned thoſe of them that <hi>feared</hi> God to <hi>keep home,</hi> Exod. 9. 20, 21, 25. When the ſword of man or Angel will deſtroy them that are abroad, it behoves <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Rahab</hi>'s <hi>family</hi> to <hi>keep within doors,</hi> Exod. 12. 22. Joſh. 2. 18, 19. If the out-lying Deer be in danger to be hunted by every Dog, and the ſtray-Sheep or Chicken to be ſnatched and torn by every Wolf or Kite, it's beſt to keep within the Pale and Fold, and under the Wing. To get and keep as near and cloſe to God, and under his Wing as may be. The Pſalmiſt's own comfortable experiences of God's goodneſs,
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:56446:201"/> whileſt he kept cloſe to him, and the ſad events of others going and keeping <hi>far from him,</hi> made him ſo wiſe as elſewhere to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, <hi>Return to thy reſt, O my ſoul,</hi> and here feelingly to conclude, <note place="margin">

            <p>In it with the <hi>Elders of Iſrael</hi> we <hi>go up to God in the Mount,</hi> Exod. 24. 11.

            <p>And thus we ſee, how by theſe and the like Ordinances, as by means appointed and ſanctified by God, we do (or at leaſt may) <hi>draw near unto him.</hi> Which ſaith theſe things to us.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But to the quickening of our care herein, I need not ſeek for more particulars to ſet forth the <hi>Soul's</hi> worth, than what I there propounded.</p>
            <p>1. Such, as the <hi>ſaving</hi> and <hi>poſſeſſing</hi> of it,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Crowns all other Enjoyments. <hi>Wiſdom with an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> doth well, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 11. but if <hi>mens ſana in corpore ſano,</hi> it's much better. It was a <hi>Solomon</hi>'s happineſs, that amidſt all his <hi>delights of the Sons of Men, his Wiſdom alſo remained with him.</hi> It's an happy ſaving Bargain indeed, if a Man, eſpecially in loſing times, when he ſaves his Eſtate and his Life, can <hi>ſave his Soul</hi> too, without which a Man with all his other Gettings and Enjoyments is but like a dead Body ſtuck with Flowers; or as a Room round-about-hung, and richly furniſhed, and nothing but the dead Maſter's Hearſe in the midſt of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Countervails all other Loſſes. <hi>David's Mouth praiſeth God with joyful Lips,</hi> though <hi>in a dry and thirſty Land,</hi> when his <hi>Soul is filled with marrow and fatneſs,</hi> Pſal. 63. 1, 5. And though he was for the outward Man at a weak paſs, yet it was a ſufficient ſupport that God had <hi>ſtrengthned him with ſtrength in his Soul,</hi> Pſal. 138. 3. Though I <hi>poſſeſs months of vanity,</hi> Job 7. 3. and with him be ejected out of all; if yet in <hi>poſſeſſion of my Soul,</hi> I am no harbourleſs Object. Though the invading Enemy hath quite broke down the Fence, and laid all open and waſte; yet as long as with the Chriſtians in <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> we have <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; When they have <hi>poſſeſſed themſelves,</hi> and taken away all with them, if they have left but a good God, and a good Conſcience; a Soul, and a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, it's but the <hi>Casket</hi> that's <hi>loſt,</hi> the <hi>Treaſure</hi> is <hi>ſaved,</hi> and lends them a Key for <hi>Paul</hi>'s Riddle of <hi>having nothing,</hi> and <hi>yet poſſeſſing all things.</hi> In this ſenſe <hi>dum Anima eſt, spes eſt,</hi> as long <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 10.</note> as my Soul is mine own, I am not only in <hi>hope,</hi> but in <hi>poſſeſſion.</hi> No cauſe to <hi>faint, though the outward Man periſh,</hi> if the <hi>inward Man be renewed,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 16. nor to complain, if the ſame hand that caſts the Chriſtian's <hi>Body</hi> to the <hi>Beaſts,</hi> caſts his <hi>Soul</hi> at the ſame time into his Saviour's Boſom. <hi>Paul</hi> meant not to <hi>kill,</hi> but to <hi>cure</hi> the <hi>inceſtuous</hi> Perſon, when he would have him <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered</hi>
               <pb n="567" facs="tcp:56446:233"/> even to <hi>Satan to the deſtruction of the fleſh,</hi> if his <hi>Spirit may but</hi> thereby <hi>be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> 1 Cor. 5 5. and that will make amends for all. Thus we ſee that the <hi>ſaving</hi> and <hi>poſſeſſing</hi> of the Soul crowns all Enjoyments, more than Countervailes all other loſſes.</p>
            <p>2. But on the contrary, the loſs of it,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Compleats all other loſſes and miſeries, and makes them utterly undoing. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of his Enemies <hi>ſpoiling of his Soul,</hi> as their greateſt cruelty, and his chiefeſt miſery, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35. 12. The Prophet, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 65. when he had given that heavy blow, that made the heart ake, <hi>Lord give them ſorrow of heart;</hi> he ſtrikes the Nail to the Head, when he adds, <hi>thy Curſe unto them. O woe unto thee, thou haſt added grief unto thy ſorrow,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jer. 45. 3.</note> and a curſe to both, when by thy riotous, unclean, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe vicious courſes, thou haſt loſt (it may be) thine Eſtate, thy good Name, the health and ſtrength of thy Body, and which is worſt of all, thy Soul and all. Undone wretch! It was a deſperate prodigal expenſe, which all the <hi>Money</hi> in thy Purſe, and thy whole <hi>other Subſtance</hi> could not diſcharge; but thy <hi>Soul</hi> alſo muſt go in to pay the reckoning. Thy Saviour's <hi>Soul</hi> being <hi>heavy to the death,</hi> was more ſad than all his bodily <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 38.</note> Sufferings, and that thruſt which lets out the heart-blood of thy Soul, is far beyond all other Wounds, and makes them deadly. To <hi>ſee an Enemy in the Habitation,</hi> is one of <hi>Eli</hi>'s ſoreſt Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 32. and to be a <hi>poſſeſſion to Enemies</hi> is <hi>Edom</hi>'s heavieſt Curſé, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. 18. but not ſo heavy, as to ſee <hi>an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my poſſeſſed</hi> of this inward <hi>Manſion.</hi> The <hi>loſs</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> compleats all other loſſes and miſeries.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Cannot be made up and recompenced with all other Gains and Enjoyments. The round World is but a Cipher to it. <hi>For what is a Man profited, if he ſhould gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul?</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 26. He that tenders a <hi>whole World,</hi> makes a great offer; but he that <hi>loſes his</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mar. 8. 37.</note> 
               <hi>Soul</hi> for it, ſuſtains a greater loſs; for that <hi>World</hi> which cannot <hi>ſatisfie</hi> the <hi>deſires</hi> of a <hi>Soul before</hi> it be <hi>loſt,</hi> cannot <hi>ſatisfie</hi> for <hi>the loſs of a Soul</hi> when it is. And therefore the <hi>rich Man,</hi> Luke 12. 19, 20. was but <hi>a Fool</hi> for all his <hi>Riches;</hi> and the <hi>Hypocrite, Job</hi> 27. 8. is brought in as a deſperate <hi>Fool</hi> for all his <hi>Gain,</hi> when <hi>God took away both their Souls.</hi> How miſerable! when dead, to have ſo many Friends to accompany the Body to the Grave, and Devils only the Soul to Hell, ſuch Funeral Pomp and Tombs?
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:56446:234"/> He that hath loſt his Soul, is a poor undone Man; though with the Young Man in the Goſpel he have never ſo <hi>great poſſeſſions:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 22.</note> For a Silk Stocken will not cure a broken Leg, nor daintieſt Meat make the ſick Man well, nor all the choiceſt Extractions from the whole Body and Bulk of the Creature, afford a Cordial ſtrong enough to revive a languiſhing loſt <hi>Soul.</hi> And therefore as the Arabick Proverb adviſeth, <hi>Noli gemmam perdere in die feſto;</hi> in our <hi>greateſt Feaſts</hi> it would <hi>not</hi> have us <hi>loſe our Jewel,</hi> becauſe it's of ſuch worth, that all the delight we can have in the coſtlieſt Meal, cannot countervail the loſs of it; ſo in all the richeſt of the World's entertainments let us be ſo merry and wiſe together, as to be ſure to look to our Jewel, to our Souls, the <hi>loſs</hi> of which all elſe can no way compenſate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As being in the laſt place irrecoverable.

            </p>
            <p>2. But wherein doth that conſiſt? Which was the ſecond Particular.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, eſpecially in two things, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. In ſo <hi>keeping the Soul,</hi> that it be not at laſt utterly loſt. 2. That for the preſent, whatever the occaſion be, it be not ſo Diſguiſed and Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, but that it may be it ſelf, and we ſtill our own Men. This was ſhewn in the general in the former Point: And now in the ſecond we are particularly to ſhew, that <hi>Chriſtian-Patience</hi> is able to do both theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Patience</hi> keeps <hi>poſſeſſion of the Soul,</hi> in taking care that it be not loſt and periſh eternally. So that we find, that <hi>patient continuance in well-doing</hi> ends <hi>in eternal Life,</hi> Rom. 2. 7. And the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 36. ſaith, that we have <hi>need of patience, that, after we have done the Will of God, we may receive the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi> There is abſolute need, eſpecially in evil Times, that the <hi>Soul be poſſeſsed with patience,</hi> if it would at laſt be poſſeſſed of <hi>Glory,</hi> as will clearly appear from the contrary. Take an impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:56446:238"/> Man, and let him meet with Trials and Exerciſes, and he preſently chuſeth <hi>Sin</hi> rather than <hi>Affliction,</hi> as the phraſe is, <hi>Job</hi> 36. 21. He cannot Suffer, and therefore he muſt Sin, nor is there the moſt dreadful and damning Sin, which in that fright and hurry he will ſtick at, or ſet him at a ſtand; but over Hedg and Ditch, though with never ſo many break-neck Falls to his Soul, that he may but eſcape that outward danger that he is more afraid of. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in his Book <hi>De bono Patientiae,</hi> and his Maſter <hi>Tertullian</hi> before him, in his Book of the like Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are large in this, to ſhew that Impatience is not only a Sin, but a Mother-ſin; that at firſt undid the <hi>Devil,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Adam;</hi> thruſt on <hi>Cain</hi> to his <hi>murder, Eſau</hi> to his <hi>profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>crucifie Chriſt,</hi> and all Hereticks to corrupt and blaſpheme the Truth of Chriſt, which was but impatience to withſtand their own Luſts; but in ſuffering time to withſtand the rage and luſts of the Devil and Men, this the fearful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing impatient Soul finds it oft an harder task: and therefore rather than ſtand out baſely, yeelds up all, and it ſelf and all; will be content to <hi>do all</hi> rather than <hi>ſuffer any thing.</hi> We may tremble, when we think of <hi>David counterfeiting the Mad-man;</hi> Peter <hi>denying and forſwearing his Lord and Maſter; Cranmer</hi> ſubſcribing, and others of the choiceſt Servants of Chriſt faultring and fowly miſcarrying in times of ſtraits and dangers: Even their Souls had hereby been <hi>loſt,</hi> if Chriſt had not ſaved them. <hi>Peter</hi> had utterly ſunk in that great Wave, had not Chriſt reached out his hand and re-ſaved him.

That Phyſician of all others I ſhould be moſt loth to diſpleaſe, who only can cure that ſore Diſeaſe that I am ſubject to, and ſhould I not then be much more afraid to offend God, who alone can be my help in all theſe Maladies, which none elſe can Heal, or at leaſt without him are <hi>Phyſicians of no value?</hi> It's not wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to provoke a Man, when we know not how ſoon we may be in his Lurch, and <hi>lie at his Mercy.</hi> Friend, how ſafe ſoever thy preſent Condition is, yet at beſt thou art always in <hi>Miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia Domini;</hi> eſpecially in ſome more eminent dangers, it's manifeſt that God only can or doth help thee: and how then do the <hi>Tyrians</hi> crouch to an <hi>offended Herod,</hi> when their <hi>Countrey is nouriſhed by his?</hi> And how do they cry <hi>Abrek, bow the Knee</hi> before <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when <hi>without him none might lift up Hand or Foot in all Egypt?</hi> Gen. 41. 43, 44. To be ſure there's none in all the World, that can lift up either <hi>Hand</hi> to deſend us, or <hi>Foot</hi> to make a ſtep to relieve us, without our <hi>Joſeph,</hi> our Jeſus, and

O take heed of <hi>ſinning,</hi> with the Prodigal, <hi>againſt Heaven;</hi> for ſuch Droughts may ſoon be, which may quite dry up all Springs of Comfort that lie here in <hi>the Earth,</hi> eſpecially in the <hi>Land of Iſrael,</hi> which hath few ſuch, as <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith, and <hi>drinks of the Rain of Heaven,</hi> depends more of Heaven's Showrs, than theſe lower earthly Springs, as <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 10, 11.

            <p>I ſaid, <hi>in a way of God.</hi> And that leads us to the following particulars. That we may with <hi>Jacob wait on God</hi> for <hi>Salvation,</hi> with ſuch expectance and confidence it's required, that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Our ſelves be under Covenant:</hi> for though to others God oft
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:56446:253"/> grants temporal <hi>Salvation,</hi> yet it's certain, that they, as ſuch, have no ground with confidence to <hi>expect</hi> it. A <hi>Rebel</hi> may poſſibly be ſpared, but it's a <hi>loyal Subject</hi> that may <hi>juſtly expect</hi> his Princes <hi>Protection,</hi> whileſt the other according to his demerit, may ſtand trembling at the Barr, and juſtly expect the Sentence of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks of a <hi>fearful looking for</hi> of <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by ſome,</hi> Heb. 10. 27. But they are the <hi>Righteous,</hi> whoſe <hi>Hope is gladneſs,</hi> whilſt the <hi>expectation of the wicked ſhall periſh,</hi> Prov. 10. 28.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Mercy</hi> or <hi>Salvation</hi> we would <hi>expect</hi> be <hi>under promiſe:</hi> for what God doth <hi>promiſe,</hi> we may confidently <hi>expect</hi> that he will aſſuredly <hi>perform,</hi> ſo that in doubtfulleſt times and caſes, our Courſe and Duty is not ſo much to ſearch into God's <hi>ſecret Will,</hi> what he will do, as into his <hi>revealed Word,</hi> what he hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in promiſed, either in general to his Church at all times, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to his People in ſome ſpecial times and caſes.

            <p n="4">4. A 4th. Conſideration to this purpoſe, and that is, of what all other Mercies and Deliverances are, <hi>beſides Chriſt &amp; his Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. They but pledges of this. Outward mercies of Chriſt and his Grace and <hi>Salvation.</hi> Indeed, they are not this in themſelves, ſo as either wicked Men that have their <hi>ſhare</hi> in <hi>them</hi> ſhould thereby have any <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>intereſt</hi> in <hi>Him,</hi> or that the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from their <hi>want</hi> of them ſhould <hi>doubt</hi> of their <hi>part in him.</hi> For in both theſe reſpects, <hi>Solomon's</hi> rule holds, By <hi>them no Man knoweth either Love or hatred,</hi> Eccleſ. 9. 1. But yet becauſe as to Believers the ſame electing Love, that deſigns Heaven and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Salvation</hi> to them in Chriſt, doth in and by him diſpenſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo outward Mercies and Deliverances (and therefore the Apoſtle from the one argueth and ariſeth to the other <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28, 29, 30.) therefore they in their enjoyment of them ſhould ſo improve them, as Iſrael's Deliverances from <hi>the Iron Furnace</hi> in <hi>Egypt and Babylon</hi> were types of their and our <hi>Salvation</hi> by <hi>Chriſt</hi> from
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:56446:260"/> the <hi>fiery Furnace</hi> of Hell and Damnation; ſo ſtill that tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Favours and protections ſhould be taſts and pledges to us of ſpiritual and eternal <hi>Salvation</hi> by Chriſt, as it was with <hi>Paul.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 17, 18. <hi>I was delivered from the Mouth of the Lyon, and the Lord ſhall deliver me from every evil work, and preſerve me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Heavenly Kingdom.</hi> But if ſo, then the thirſty Soul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſatisfied with ſuch taſts, but by them rather hath its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite further quickned after thoſe fuller draughts of Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Mercy in Chriſt. And theſe leſſer <hi>pledges</hi> draw it out in more earneſt longings after thoſe <hi>greater matters,</hi> and which it far more looks after. For although in ſome other caſes the pledge may in worth equal, yea and exceed the thing inſured and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, yet here it's far otherwiſe. This pledg is ſcarce an <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt penny,</hi> and therefore will not ſatisfy the wary Soul inſtead of its full payment. And ſo, though it hath this Earneſt, yet it looks ſtill for the <hi>Principal.</hi> Though delivered by <hi>Sampſon,</hi> yet ſtill <hi>waits on God</hi> for his <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe outward Mercies and Deliverances are given and intended by God in a ſanctified uſe of them, to be as means, and as it were under-ſteps to lift up the Heart to higher deſires and enjoyments of Chriſt and <hi>Salvation:</hi> As <hi>Zacheus</hi> by getting up into the <hi>Sycomore-Tree,</hi> gets a ſight of Chriſt. In theſe more ſavourable and liberal entertainments in our way, God never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that with the <hi>drowſie Diſciples,</hi> we ſhould dream of <hi>pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Tabernacles,</hi> and ſay it's good to be here; but that,</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Accommodations</hi> on the one hand ſhould be as our <hi>via<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum</hi> and incouragements.</p>
            <p>And thoſe <hi>Deliverances</hi> on the other hand remove diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſtumbling-blocks in our way to <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The one build our Scaffold, that we might better <hi>edify our ſelves</hi> in the <hi>Faith of Chriſt;</hi> as Act. 9. 31. when <hi>the Churches had reſt and peace, they were edified, walking in the fear of God, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And therefore the Lord by his Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> Chap. 2. after he had promiſed <hi>plenty</hi> of other food. <hi>v.</hi> 26. adds a Promiſe of <hi>pouring</hi> out his Spirit, <hi>v.</hi> 28. The other are but to free us from incumbrances, that we might <hi>vacare Deo,</hi> and ſerve him with leſs <hi>diſtraction,</hi> as <hi>Zachary</hi> ſings, <hi>being delivered out of the hands of our Enemies, might ſerve him without fear, in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs before him all the days of our Life,</hi> Luke 1. 74, 75.</p>
            <pb n="622" facs="tcp:56446:261"/>
            <p> Indeed we are too ſubject ſo to abuſe and pervert ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward helps, that on the contrary they too oft prove hindrances, <hi>Snares</hi> and <hi>Thorns</hi> to intangle us in our advance to Heaven, ſo that ſometimes we never had leſs of Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> than when we had moſt of the World, and our being ſet free from trouble is but the <hi>opening</hi> the Cage or Priſon-door for <hi>looſe</hi> hearts to run further from God.</p>
            <p>Who thereby is inforced, that he may recover us out of thoſe wild vagaries, to bring us into ſome narrow deep Lanes beſet on both ſides with <hi>Thorns,</hi> the better to keep us in our way; and to break thoſe Crutches, which we too much reſted on, that we may be taught to <hi>lean upon our Beloved in a Wilderneſs,</hi> Cant. 8. 5. and ſo we come to make more ſpeed to our journey's end, when lightned of that Luggage, which ſo much loaded and hindred us in our way.</p>
            <p>But that is from <hi>God's Grace.</hi> Mean while it's a great part of <hi>our folly and perverſeneſs</hi> to turn our helps into hindrances. He at once both wrongs himſelf and his Friend's courteſy, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Stool lent him to reach ſomething he hath great need of, when he hath gotten upon it, only ſtands ſtrutting upon it, and braving over others that are under him, till inſtead of reaching what he wanteth, falls down headlong. He is a fooliſh Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that when the Maſter of the Ship puts him aſhore for his refreſhment, or to take in ſomething for his accommodation, ſtayeth ſo long gathering Shels on the Sand, or Flowers in the Meadow, that he loſeth his Voyage: Nor is he the wiſeſt Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, who for the more comfort and ſpeed of his Journey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his Friend led in a plain fair way, and through pleaſant Meadows, is ſo taken with them, that he lies down to ſleep in them, forgetting his Errand, and ſo loiters as loth to part with them, as that he is benighted and falls ſhort of Home. A good Traveller is of another mind, and takes another courſe; ſaith, the Coaſt indeed is clear and free from Theeves and Robbers, the way pleaſant, and Inns and other Accommodations by the way commodious; but yet for all that (as it is in the Proverb) <hi>utinam domi eſſem,</hi> I would I were at home: And ſo, the fairer the way is, the more haſte he makes and puts on. It is or ſhould be ſo with every true Traveller Heaven-ward. If in his way he meet with trouble and danger, he ſaith I would I were at Home in Heaven, where there is none of this: but if ſafety and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, yet would I were at Home in Heaven, where there is
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:56446:261"/> much better than this: Heaven is my Haven, and theſe are but fair Gales to carry me on with more ſpeed thither. Chriſt is the End I aim at; and therefore as <hi>Auſtin</hi> upon that Title of the Pſalm: <hi>In finem cum audis, in Chriſtum intende, ne in vita</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 55.</note> 
               <hi>remanendo non pervenias ad finem:</hi> When I hear of <hi>the End,</hi> I muſt think of making after Chriſt, and not ſtand ſtill in my way, leſt I come not to my Journey's end. <hi>Quicquid eſt ubi in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fra ſteteris, antequam ad Chriſtum perveneris, nihil aliud Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ſermo dicit, niſi Accede.</hi> How firm ſoever the Ground be that I ſtand upon, on this ſide of Chriſt, though Senſe and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reaſon ſay, <hi>ſtand ſtill and abide by it;</hi> yet Scripture hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to ſay to me but this one word, <hi>Ariſe, this is not thy reſting place,</hi> Mic. 2. 10.

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. And this Thirdly, By reaſon of the little advantage of the one, if we fall ſhort of the other.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And ſo ſecondly, On the other hand, when God <hi>completeth</hi> an outward Mercy and Deliverance, he is wont to do more for the inward than for the outward Man; in <hi>Mercy</hi> to <hi>Hezekiah's Soul</hi> draws his <hi>Body out of the Pit of Corruption,</hi> and <hi>caſts his</hi>

And therefore (as ſome of our <note place="margin">Cartwright, Hiſt.

            </p>
            <p>Which, in the Application of it, ſhews us (Firſt) a broad <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>1</label> difference between a Right-born, and a Baſtard <hi>Iſraelite.</hi> The <hi>Sons of the Concubines</hi> were put off and ſatisfied with <hi>Gifts,</hi> but <hi>Iſaac, the Son of the Promiſe,</hi> muſt have <hi>the Inheritance.</hi> The <hi>Carnal Jews</hi> ſit down by it in <hi>Babylon,</hi> but thoſe that were more <note place="margin">1 Chron. 4. 23.</note> Spiritual returned to <hi>Zion;</hi> as the Raven takes up with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,

            </p>
            <p>It's on the one hand a plain evidence of a carnal worldly Heart to reſt ſatisfied with Proſperity and Safety without Chriſt and his Salvation. A ſign of an <hi>Harlot,</hi> to be contented with the <hi>Love-token</hi> without true deſire of the <hi>Lover.</hi> As of the Mungril-Cur in the Fable, to leave the Game, and to take up with the Gobbet caſt before him: Unchaſte Soul, that commiteſt folly with the Gift, and neglecteſt God the Giver; faſtneſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Bait, and art not drawn to Chriſt, who would draw thee to himſelf by that <hi>Cord of Love:</hi> Like the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Fiſher, that caſts away the <hi>Net</hi> when he hath caught the <hi>Fiſh</hi> he <hi>fiſhed for;</hi> openeth the Door of the Heart ſo wide, as to take in an outward Mercy from the Hand of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and then ſhuts it againſt him, who thereby would have made way for himſelf to enter in; nay, (it may be) with thoſe <hi>Husband-men</hi> in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, will <hi>kill the Heir,</hi> that they may <hi>have the Inheritance;</hi> ſhakes hands and quits <hi>Chriſt</hi> with <hi>Demas,</hi> to <hi>embrace the World:</hi>

            </p>
            <p>For ſo on the other hand, a <hi>Jacob's,</hi> and every true <hi>Iſraelite's</hi> heart that is touched with ſenſe of the emptineſs of all elſe, and the only All-ſufficient fulneſs of Chriſt, after fulleſt draughts of

So a true Chriſtian, whoſe Heart is indeed touched with the Love of Chriſt, though he might have <hi>Chains of Gold</hi> to bind him down to fit ſtill by what the World can afford him, yet he cannot reſt but in the Boſom of his Saviour.

<pb n="627" facs="tcp:56446:263"/> as <hi>Media diaphana,</hi> as clear Chryſtal Glaſs, that might tranſmit the Beams of <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſs to our Souls: Looking-Glaſſes,</hi> in which we may ſee Chriſt; or as ſo many <hi>Shadows,</hi> that better commend and ſet out to us the Beauty of Chriſt, that by theſe Streams we may be led up to the <hi>Spring-Head,</hi> and by theſe <hi>Rivers</hi> led out to the <hi>Ocean.</hi> This is the right Spiritualizing and Sublimating theſe low and groſs earthly Enjoyments: Not a Roſicrucian <hi>Philoſophica Theologizata;</hi> nor the <hi>Libertine Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt</hi> high-flown <hi>Allegorical, Myſtical</hi> Divinity; Or the <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts</hi> crying up the <hi>Spirit,</hi> whilſt he wallows in the <hi>Luſts of the Fleſh:</hi> But a plain Honeſt-hearted Chriſtian's taking advantage from outward things, to be raiſed up to Spiritual and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: As a Man from the <hi>riſe</hi> of a <hi>Hill</hi> makes a greater <hi>Leap,</hi> and as the <hi>Bird,</hi> which from the Tree takes a <hi>longer-flight;</hi> ſo from the advantage of the higher Ground of an outward Exaltation and Deliverance, inſtead of being lifted and puft up in Pride, to have the Heart raiſed up to diviner thoughts, and more ardent deſires of God and Heaven; as he, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 15. whilſt ſitting at Meat with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> raiſeth up his thoughts to the <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> of him that <hi>eats Bread in the Kingdom of God.</hi> This <hi>Meat</hi> is <hi>pleaſant;</hi> but Oh! what then is the <hi>Bread of Life?</hi> This <hi>Garment comely;</hi> But how Glorious then the Robe of Righteouſneſs?

               </gap> is truly <hi>Divine,</hi> when an holy Heart out of Terrene and Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things extracts the <hi>Elixir</hi> or <hi>Divineſt Contemplation</hi> and <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and Heaven.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe God even in <hi>Paradiſe</hi> would have ſome Trees <hi>Sacramental</hi> and <hi>Myſtical,</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> in that Garden might riſe higher than <hi>Philoſophical ſpeculation,</hi> and not periſh by a <hi>Tree of Knowledg,</hi> but be fed and live by a <hi>Tree of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for this end likewiſe, Chriſt as he uſeth ſo many <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> and ſpiritualizeth outward things, ſo he is ſet out by the Name of ſome of the Chief and Choice of all kinds of Beings.

            <p>Which therefore (in the laſt place) is that which we ſhould all be ſeriouſly exhorted to: <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>3</label>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That we would not have our deſires <hi>terminated,</hi> and ſo take up with any or all ſuch outward Mercies and <hi>Salvations</hi> which in the World we may be entertain'd with, but ſtill to ſeek on, till we find a better <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> which we may ſafely and quietly reſt in; as <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> ſtay not with their <hi>Kinsfolk and Acquaintance,</hi> till they find the <hi>Child Jeſus,</hi> Luke 2. 44, 45, 46. and mean while they ſeek him <hi>ſorrowing,</hi> ver. 48. The Beggar that is ready to die for Hunger, though he have never ſo much elſe given him, if not Food, waits ſtill as wanting that which he came for, and had moſt need of. When Chriſt ſaid to the <hi>Blind-man, What wilt thou that I ſhall</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luke 18. 41.</note> 
               <hi>do unto thee?</hi> His anſwer is, <hi>Lord, that I may receive my ſight.</hi> A Sinner that hath his Eyes ſo far open as to ſee Chriſt's Worth, and his own want of him, would have ſaid, <hi>Lord, that I might receive Thee.</hi> A poor Believer hath a further and greater Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand to Chriſt, than for <hi>Corn and Wine,</hi> or outward Safety and Proſperity, which thoſe in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>howled upon their Beds for.</hi> He hath a Soul to be both ſaved and ſatisfied; and nothing can do either of them, but Chriſt only. O that we had ſuch hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring thirſting deſires after him, that nothing might ſtay our Stomachs without him, much-leſs take away our Stomachs (as too too oft they do from him). Nor is this all that Speech of <hi>Jacob</hi> calls upon us for; not only not to be taken off or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the out-goings of our Souls to Chriſt, by being ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with thoſe outward Mercies and Deliverances: But</p>
            <p n="2">2. By them (as Helps) to be drawn out and raiſed up in our deſires after him. It's great Mercy, if by any means our Hearts may be led out to him, though they be the <hi>Horrors</hi> of <hi>Conſcience</hi> that prick us, the <hi>Terrors</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> that whip us, outward <hi>Wants</hi> that drive us, or Dangers that affright us: It's well if any thing will bring us, even <hi>Chains</hi> of <hi>Affliction</hi> will draw us to him, but yet not ſo well as if they were thoſe <hi>Cords of Love:</hi> If we might be preſerved in Sugar, rather than in Brine: If
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:56446:264"/> comfortable Supplies and Deliverances be not as <hi>Seats</hi> to ſit down, but as <hi>Foot-ſtools</hi> to get up to Chriſt by.</p>
            <p>In times of Want and Danger to ſeek Chriſt, may be rather to <hi>ſeek our ſelves</hi> than <hi>him,</hi> and to make our ſelves our <hi>End,</hi> when we only make uſe of Chriſt as a <hi>means</hi> to it. Such may be ſhaken off with <hi>Jephtah's</hi> check: <hi>Ye did thus and thus unto me, and why are you come to me now that ye are in diſtreſs,</hi> Judg. 11. 7. more out of love of your ſelves than to me. And the like alſo may be ſaid, if</p>
            <p>In times of enjoyment of Mercy and Deliverance we rejoyce in God, and ſeem to love and praiſe him. This alſo may be <hi>Self-love</hi> rather than the <hi>Love of God.</hi> They might <hi>rejoyce in God's great Goodneſs,</hi> Neh. 9. 25. who yet did <hi>not ſerve him in his great Goodneſs,</hi> ver. 35. And he might ſay, <hi>Bleſſed be God, for I am rich,</hi> Zech. 11. 5. who yet never truly praiſed him. This may be but their <hi>following of Chriſt for Loaves,</hi> John 6. 26. as the Roman Emperours did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <note place="margin">Heinſius Exercit.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But thus to love God and Chriſt in his Mercies, that He is the <hi>Oyl of Gladneſs,</hi> ſwimming on the top of all; that we are no way ſatisfied with them without him, and beſt ſatisfied when we enjoy Him in them and by them; this ſhews the <hi>ingenuity</hi> of our <hi>Love,</hi> and that it's not the <hi>World</hi> or <hi>Self,</hi> but Chriſt that is the <hi>Object</hi> of it: That as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to his <hi>Corinthians, I ſeek not yours, but you;</hi> ſo it is not our ſelves, but Chriſt that we <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 14.</note> love and deſire; and not his <hi>Portion,</hi> but his <hi>Perſon;</hi> and not ſo much <hi>Man's,</hi> as <hi>his Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore (to conclude) as in all <hi>our gettings, we are to get Wiſdom,</hi> Prov. 4. 7. So, in all our ſeekings let us ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt: And in and above all our Enjoyments let us enjoy and eye Him. As <hi>Jacob</hi> here in <hi>Sampſon's ſalvation</hi> had a further longing look at <hi>His.</hi> And ſo <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. in a <hi>Samuel</hi> looks at a <hi>Saviour.</hi> And therefore (as it hath been obſerved by ſome) her Song at his Birth, and <hi>Mary's</hi> at the news of Chriſt's, in many Paſſages of both very much agree, and are perfect <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niſons.</hi> And this further that Song of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> will to our preſent purpoſe inform us, that the Eying of Chriſt in all other Mercies will,</p>

Though <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as the Serpent by the way ſo bites the Horſe heels, that his Rider falls backward,</hi> and ſo he is ſaved from him, yet that's not enough, not all that he looks for: And therefore he adds, <hi>I have waited for thy Salvation, O Lord.</hi>

Not ſuch an one as <hi>David</hi> was in, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 14. when he was to chuſe which of three Evils, but of two Good things, and both ſo Good, that he knew not which to make choice of.

But <hi>Paul's</hi> both Caſe and Temper here was far better. Becauſe <hi>Death</hi> would have been his own <hi>gain,</hi> ſo he could willingly have made choice of it: But becauſe his Life would be Chriſt's and the Church's advantage (which he muſt prefer before him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and therefore deny himſelf rather than them) ſo; as Chriſt, when Nature ſimply would have deſired Life, out of Obedience <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 39, 42.</note> to his Father, choſe Death; ſo, on the contrary (but from the ſame Spirit) the Apoſtle <hi>Mortem habet in deſiderio, vitam in patientiâ.</hi> When Self-intereſt would have made choice of <hi>Death,</hi> Chriſt's Intereſt makes him chuſe <hi>Life.</hi> And happy he, that he might ſo well do either, ſeeing <hi>to him to live was Chriſt, and to die was gain.</hi> Chriſt, (as other Interpreters and Tranſlators <note place="margin">Calvin, Beza, C. a Lapide.</note> render it) being to him <hi>both in Life and Death advantage.</hi> This latter reading <hi>Calvin</hi> preſerreth, as containing a leſs forced Senſe, and a more full Doctrine, and beſt agreeing with the words foregoing in the precedent Verſe, in which the Apoſtle expreſſed himſelf <hi>confident, that Chriſt ſhould be magnified in him,</hi>

            <p>And ſo in the words of the Text (ſpoken by <hi>Paul,</hi> both as an Apoſtle, and as a Believer) we have theſe two Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, 1. A good days Work. 2. A good evenings Wages and nights Reſt. The Work and Buſineſs of a true Chriſtian's Life, and the Happineſs of his Death, the one is Chriſt, the other is Gain: <hi>For to me to live is Chriſt, and to die is gain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt then is this, That Chriſt is a true Chriſtian's Life: <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> or rather in the words of the Text, To a true Believer to <hi>Live</hi> is <hi>Chriſt:</hi> For ſo <hi>Zanchy</hi> obſerves, that the Apoſtle doth not ſay, Chriſt is <hi>his Life,</hi> as the efficient cauſe of it, but <hi>Ipſum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,</hi> his very Life was Chriſt, as the Final cauſe of it, the whole that he did and aimed at in it. So that Chriſt is not the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of the Propoſition, as <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> would have it, but the <hi>Predicate,</hi> ſo that whatever he either projected or acted, Chriſt might be predicated of it, it had the Signature of Chriſt, ſomething of Chriſt, as the Principle or Effect, End or Object of it was ſtamped and found upon it; But herein I liſt not to be over-curious.

            <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, On the Chriſtian's part, Chriſt is his Life, in that he deſireth and endeavoureth to make him ſo, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he <hi>live in the Fleſh,</hi> (as he ſpeaks in the following Verſe) yet he liveth not to the Fleſh, but to Chriſt. His Natural Life he looks at as a Mercy, as in which he hath opportunities and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to honour and ſerve God, and to do Good to himſelf and others: Otherwiſe to live, only to live, though it be with eaſe, content, and pleaſure, it's not worth the while, as that which Beaſts as much, it may be more than we, attain to; but if (as oftentimes it falls out with many) which we ſee (as we are wont to ſay) labouring for Life in Penury and Infamy with bodily Pains and Sickneſs, and inward Horror and Anguiſh, <hi>Death</hi> hath by many been deſired, rather than ſuch a <hi>Life:</hi> It is <hi>Vita minime vitalis:</hi> But <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>But how and in what reſpects doth a Chriſtian thus make Chriſt <hi>his Life?</hi>

And theſe laſt words give a ſufficient Reaſon of the former: if we are <hi>the Lords,</hi> then we ſhould <hi>live to the Lord;</hi> if we be not <hi>our own</hi> Men, but Chriſt's ranſomed Servants, then, as the Maſter's Service, Honour, and Advantage, is or ought to be the Servant's aim and ſcope in his whole Employment, ſo Chriſt's ſhould be ours, and ſo He becomes our Life. For we <hi>live</hi> much in our Ends and Deſigns which we project and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to promote, and according to them, though not only yet eſpecially, our Lives are to be judged of; as in other Caſes, ſo in this Particular, if the conſtant Tendencies and real Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Souls be ſeriouſly for Chriſt, to pleaſe, honour, and ſerve Him, this is to have Chriſt for our life, and thus to <hi>live</hi> (in the Apoſtle's Phraſe here) <hi>is Chriſt,</hi> when (as he ſpake in the Verſe foregoing) our <gap reason="foreign">

In a word, when we own no other Intereſts but Chriſt's, or at leaſt none that are

And he was as good as his word, his Practice herein being very obſervable for our imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in theſe following particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. In delighting very often, and upon all occaſions to make mention of the Name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> above 450 times in his fourteen Epiſtles, <hi>hoc patiebatur Paulus ex nimio amore Chriſti, ut</hi>

               <hi>quem diligebat ſuperflue &amp; extraordinarie nominaret,</hi> as Hierom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it. It ſeems Chriſt lived much in his Heart, when out of the abundance of it he breathes him ſo faſt, and his Mouth <note place="margin">

               </note> ſo <hi>abundantly</hi> ſpeaks of him, and that ſo very often, that by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Elegancy it would be counted a Tautology, but yet no Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Battology, which appears in ſome of their ſuperſtitious Prayers, too too affectedly repeating the Name of Jeſus to make as it were a Charm of it, and with the upſtart Sect of <hi>Jeſuits</hi> would be known by their continual both at home and abroad na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Name <hi>Jeſus.</hi> But <hi>Paul,</hi> that had none of their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, had more love of Chriſt in this his ſo frequent (not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, but) affectionate naming of him.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="662" facs="tcp:56446:281"/> 2. Obſerve likewiſe, that to this purpoſe he ſtudiouſly taketh, (nay, often in his Writings maketh) occaſions to make mention of him, and as it were caſts about to bring him in, as we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do to meet with a Friend, or to give occaſion of Speech of that which our Heart is ſet upon. So the Vain-glorious Man is wont to hook in a Diſcourſe, which may give occaſion of ſpeech of that, by which he might fan to himſelf his own praiſe: But humble <hi>Paul</hi> ſo, as that thereby he might take opportunity to Exalt the Honour of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Take notice alſo, when he hath ſo gotten an Opportunity of mentioning Chriſt, how then he runneth Deſcant upon it; and, as though he had left and forgotten what formerly he was ſpeaking of, what large and long Excurſions he makes into this happy <hi>Latifundium,</hi> even to <hi>Hyperbatons</hi> and <hi>Anantapodotons,</hi>

His Intereſt ſhould direct, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, ſubordinate and qualify all. As the Box ſmells of the Musk that is in it, ſo ſhould all our deſigns and undertakings of Chriſt; and as the Artery goeth along with the Vein, ſo ſhould Chriſt with whatever our warmeſt Life-Bloud runneth in; and therefore our thoughts ſhould run much in this Channel. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> ſaid to <hi>Laban, thou knoweſt how I have ſerved thee, but when ſhall I provide for my own Houſe?</hi> Gen. 30. 29, 30.

By all theſe Employments and Attainments, I have exalted my ſelf, but have they been as ſo many under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps to lift up Chriſt the more, and me nearer to him? I have other ways gained ſo much, and ſo much, but how much, or rather how little have I gained to my Lord and Maſter by them?

But yet (ſaving this humble ſubmiſſion) if to us to live be <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to do him ſervice, then, when we can no longer ſo live to him, it beſeemeth us to be content and willing with his leave to dye in him, when our Day is done, to be glad to go to Bed, and when our Work is over to go to our Reſt, as <hi>David, Act.</hi> 13. 36. and Chriſt himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 17. 4, 5. <hi>I have glorified thee on Earth, I have finiſhed the work that thou gaveſt me to do, and now, O Father, Glorify thou me with thine own ſelf;</hi> and ſo our <hi>Paul,</hi> when he had once <hi>fought the good Fight, and finiſhed his Race,</hi> then he reacheth out his hand to the Garland and <hi>Crown,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 7, 8.</p>

            <p>To teach us, that for the <hi>Matter</hi> of our Preaching, we ſhould not read a Lecture of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> or bare Morality, which they that never heard of Chriſt might do as well as we, and ſo (as ſome complained of the Schoolmen.) make <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> Ethicks our Bible, or the Documents of <hi>Plato,</hi> whom we call <hi>Divine,</hi> our Divinity: And ſo none might find Chriſt in our Sermons more than <hi>Auſtin</hi> did his Name in <hi>Tullie's</hi> Works.</p>

The Apoſtle here writes the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's Inventory, and <hi>inter peculia,</hi> amongſt all their other Goods, he ſets down Death for one part of them: and therefore, as other Goods are therefore ſo called, becauſe they are for the good of the Owner; ſo <hi>Death</hi> is reckoned amongſt them, becauſe by Chriſt it's for the great good and gain of the Believer: For if <hi>all things work together</hi> for <hi>the good of them that love God,</hi> Rom. 8. 28. then Death alſo, for it is alſo reckoned among thoſe <hi>all things,</hi> ver. 38.

            <p>And for further Proof, it appears that they are fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded and aſſured of it: Elſe</p>
            <p n="1">1. They would never ſo deſire it before it come: For Evil and Loſs, as ſuch can never be the object of Deſire, but it muſt appear to be good and profitable if deſired; but ſo Death hath

               <hi>God, When ſhall I come and appear before God?</hi> The Moraliſt's Maxime is, <hi>Summam nec metuas diem, nec optes,</hi> that we ſhould neither fear Death, nor deſire it: But a truly believing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian goeth higher, hath <hi>Vitam in patientiâ, mortem in deſiderio,</hi> fears not Death becauſe it can do him no Dammage, but, deſires it, becauſe it brings with it greateſt Gain.—And upon this ground as he deſires it before it come:</p>
            <p n="2">2. So with Joy he welcomes it when it doth come; yea, though in a violent way: As <hi>Ignatius</hi> bleſſed God upon <hi>Trajan's</hi> condemning him, <hi>Cum gaudio circumponens vincula:</hi> The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr <note place="margin">

And if ſo with them that went up to Heaven with <hi>Elijah</hi> in a <hi>fiery Chariot,</hi> and a <hi>Whirl-wind:</hi> Then, no wonder, if ſo with them that are carried hence by the conduct of a more placid and eaſie departure; and if ſome only from wearineſs of this troubleſome Life account Death ſuch a <hi>Gain</hi> as to <hi>dig for</hi> it <hi>as for bid Treaſure, and rejoyce exceedingly,</hi> and are <hi>glad</hi> when <hi>they find the Grave,</hi> Job 3. 21, 22. then we may well conceive how glad the aſſured Believer may be of it, when he knows he ſhall be greater Gainer by it, as not only <hi>reſting</hi> from his <hi>Labours</hi> of this Life, but alſo then entring into his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting both Reſt and Joy in a better Life, which thoſe others may not then meet with, but the contrary. But if upon this ground the Righteous hath ſuch <hi>hope in his Death,</hi> Prov. 14. 32. then I hope you will not deny him Joy in it, and if Joy then <hi>Gain</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>But this will more particularly be made out, if we conſider the ſeveral kinds of Deaths of Believers. And (as I even

               <hi>Die for Chriſt,</hi> than to be King of the whole Earth. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought it was the greateſt Gain. To be ſure, Chriſt will ſee they ſhall be no loſers; who hath given his Word that he that <hi>findeth his Life ſhall loſe it, and he that loſeth his Life for his ſake, ſhall find it,</hi> Mat. 10. 39. &amp; 16. 25. And becauſe we know not what God may call us to, it will be good to encourage and <hi>comfort</hi> our ſelves <hi>with theſe Words,</hi> and with firm belief of this undoubted Truth, that they who <hi>Die for Chriſt</hi> are greateſt <hi>Gainers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And if it be but <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> moſt happy Gains will come in to us by that alſo: And that both Privative and Poſitive.</p>
            <p>1. Firſt Privative; for ſuch a kind of Gain we find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as <hi>Acts</hi> 27. 21. that phraſe of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, where <hi>Paul</hi> tells them that were in the Ship with him, that if they had followed his advice, they might have <hi>gained that Loſs;</hi> that is, they might have prevented it: And ſuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a firſt kind of <hi>Gain</hi> the Faithful have by Death, in freeing them from that both Sin and Miſery, either by ending what before they were in, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting what, if they had lived longer, they might have fallen into.</p>
            <p>1. It ends</p>
            <p>Sin, which all our Lifes-time we were wofully encumbred with, which made <hi>Paul</hi> ſo ſadly groan out that complaint, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of Death?</hi> That is, either this outward mortal Body, or this inward body of Sin which is more mortal. Both may be taken into the Senſe, becauſe both are together in the Event; not till the death of our Bodies is the body of Sin quite dead in us; but then it will be: for as Sin entred into us at the firſt union of
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:56446:290"/> Body and Soul, ſo it goeth not out till their laſt diſſolution. But being then parted,</p>
            <p>As to the Body, for fins of omiſſion, this lump of Earth doth no longer <hi>aggravare animam,</hi> clog the Soul from doing duty; nor as to ſins of commiſſion, doth this <hi>Earthly</hi> duſty <hi>tabernacle</hi> any longer defile the Soul, as being a <hi>fomes,</hi> and an Inſtrument by which it acts its ſelf-pollution.</p>
            <p>And as to the Soul, though wicked Mens Souls are <hi>in ſtatu ſeparato</hi> as ſinful as they were before, yet <hi>the ſpirits of juſt Men are then made perfect,</hi> Heb. 12. 23. and therefore not liable to ſin, which is the greateſt imperfection. And what a gain this is, a holy Heart will tell you, when now groaning under the Burden and Pollution of ſome defiling luſt, would give a whole World to be rid of it, even exchange his life for Death, becauſe by it he ſhall gain a full deliverance from it.</p>
            <p>And as Death ends the Believer's ſin: So alſo all that miſery, which by reaſon of his ſin he more or leſs all his Life long was exerciſed with. No more inward ſorrows or fears, or anguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and perplexities in and from himſelf, no more temptations from Satan, no more moleſtations or perſecutions from the World; or if any, he is no more ſenſible of them. <hi>There the wicked ceaſe from troubling, and there the weary are at reſt; there the Priſoners reſt together, they hear not the voice of the oppreſſor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Job. 3. 17, 18. And if you ſay, that for theſe outward troubles it is then as well with the wickedeſt ſinners as with the holieſt Saints: I ſay, but it is not ſo as to thoſe inward anguiſhes and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are the greateſt miſeries; for they in the wicked are not then ended, but (as to their greateſt extremities) then begin. But for the Godly no more [then] any of theſe: They then <hi>ceaſe</hi> from all their <hi>Labours,</hi> Revel. 14. 13. and <hi>reſt quietly in their Beds,</hi> Iſa. 57. 2. not one bodily pain, or diſquieting thought more: as Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> on his death-bed, being asked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether his <note place="margin">See his Life.</note> pains were great, anſwered, that he did not eſteem that a pain, which would be to him the end of all trouble, and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of endleſs Joys. <hi>Serve the Lord in Fear, and Death ſhall not be troubleſome to you. Bleſſed is the Death of thoſe that have part in the Blood of Jeſus.</hi> And is not he who hath attained to this proved a great Gainer, having all his former ſins and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſo well and for ever ended?</p>
            <p>2. And whatſoever of both kinds, if he had lived longer, he might have fallen into, moſt happily prevented. The Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:56446:291"/> 
               <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Enoch</hi> was <hi>ſpeedily taken away,</hi> leſt <hi>wickedneſs</hi> ſhould have <hi>altered his underſtanding,</hi> Wiſdom 4. 11. But I am ſure from authentical Scripture, that <hi>Joſiah</hi> was, that he might not ſee that deſolation which was coming upon his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, 2 Chron. 34. 28. and that the <hi>Righteous are taken away from the evil to come,</hi> Iſa. 57. 1. of which ſome expound that <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 13. <hi>Bleſſed are they that dye in the Lord,</hi> namely at that time there meant, becauſe after that time there would be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter miſery. It may be we cannot but think how miſerable ſome Men would have been, if they had lived any longer, yea, and what ſinful Snares ſome of God's Servants would have been in danger to have been taken in, if they had not died the ſooner. But when they were now falling, a Fathers watchful eye ſaw their danger, and with a wary hand ſnatcht them out of it, and took them into his own Boſom, out of the reach of it. Bleſſed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! Happy Child! And <hi>gainful Death!</hi> that put them into har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, when the ſtorm was coming that would have ſunk them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented thoſe ſins and miſeries that might have undone them. And thus Death to the Godly is <hi>gain</hi> privatively in preventing loſs.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, Poſitively in bringing in realleſt Gains.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of Grace made perfect, and that in the moſt perfect exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and operation of it. <hi>Faith</hi> then completed in <hi>Viſion,</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> in <hi>Fruition,</hi> and therefore called <hi>the end of our Faith,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 9. not ſo much of ceſſation, as the conſummation and perfection of both: and for Love; what was here <hi>imperfect ſhall then be done away,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 10.

In former times with Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Divines, and others before them, there were but two Receptacles of Souls departed, either Heaven, or Hell; and if they that dye in Chriſt be not in Hell, I hope they are in Heaven, and if there, then moſt happy: and if Death ſend them thither, then what <hi>gain</hi> they get by it, they will think of, and bleſs God for, to Eternity.</p>
            <p>The ſum of all theſe particular proofs is epitomized in that ſhort ſaying of <hi>Auſtin, Mors beatitudinis principium, laborum meta, peremptoria peccatorum;</hi> It kills Sin, ends Miſery, begins Happineſs in Grace and Glory, and therefore upon all Accounts it's gain to the Godly.</p>

            <p>And therefore, what ſhould our greateſt care and endeavour be, but that we may attain to this happineſs, that Death which <label type="milestone">

It's a buſy World we live in, and except only ſuch ſlothful Drones, or debauched Prodigals, who labour for nothing, but to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy their Eaſe or their Luſts, all that would not be idle and ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Bruits, are buſy in trading, in ſomething or other, that they think will turn to account, and bring in ſome advantage, and procure at leaſt a livelihood; but alas it's only a livelihood, it's for a ſhort life only: but there are too few that think what will be <hi>gain</hi> to them at <hi>Death,</hi> when they will be in greateſt need of ſomething that may make their <hi>hearts</hi> then to <hi>live,</hi> upon which they may live to Eternity. And therefore it would be a great part of their Wiſdom and Thrift, whilſt they think they have too little time to compaſs their other ends and projects to <hi>gain time</hi> (as the phraſe is <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 8.) to get ready a Cordial againſt that ſwooning Fit, that they may be <hi>gainers</hi> not only at <hi>Death,</hi> but by it, when time ſhall be no more. So they may be gainers indeed, and be <hi>profitable to themſelves,</hi> as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſaith, <hi>a wiſe Man is profitable to himſelf,</hi> Job. 22. 2. and that gain will not be only great, but ſo ſure, that there will be no undoing after-claps, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith there will be with others after their greateſt <hi>gains, when God takes away their Souls,</hi> Job. 27. 8. <hi>Socrates,</hi> the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died, was deſirous to learn Muſick: happy we, if then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inſtead of fears and ſorrows for the loſſes we ſhall then under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, we can make melody in our Hearts, but it will be good to have been tuning of them to it before.</p>
            <p>And for this purpoſe</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="687" facs="tcp:56446:293"/> 1. Let it be one great part of our good Husbandry not to deal in, or to make a trade of any ſin, which in other reſpects we may account moſt gainful and profitable; for it will certainly eat out all our gains, it may be in this Life, whilſt God blaſts them, or our Souls be blaſted, and (it may be here) tormented by them. <hi>Solomon's</hi> word will for certain be found true, <hi>the wicked worketh a deceitful work,</hi> Prov. 11. 18. and it is the word of him that repents for ſin, <hi>I have ſinned, and it profited me not,</hi> Job. 33. 27. <note place="margin">Iſa. 44. 9, 10, &amp; 47. 12. &amp; 57. 12.

But to be ſure at Death it will more fully appear to be ſo, when ſuch <hi>gains</hi> will not only be loſt, but prove <hi>loſs,</hi> whilſt we are for ever loſt by them. The very <hi>Sting of Death</hi> is <hi>Sin,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 56. and then, although we before thought the gain of ſin was ſweet, <note place="margin">

            <p n="2">2. Learn to undervalue the World more, with all the gains, profits, and contentments of it: for if we be of the <hi>Men of the World, who have their Portion in this Life,</hi> and they be our Portion, they</p>

            </p>
            <p>And it will be Death indeed to us, when we muſt die; when all that is loſt and ſcattered, which the very Life of our Souls was wrapt up in; when ſuch Men (with him, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 19.) ſee that <hi>all hopes</hi> of after<hi>-gains</hi> are <hi>gone,</hi> they then ſink into Deſpair, before their Souls do into Hell; nay when they ſee all their former <hi>gains</hi> are loſt, they are loſt too, and ſo end their lives with that Emperour's laſt words <gap reason="foreign">

And to this day it's a very ſhort cut that ſome are ready to make from a Death-bed to Heaven; they have been Baptized, and by it Original ſin was taken away from them, and they have gone to Church to Prayer, Sermon, and Sacrament, and if then at the point of Death they may have their actual ſins taken off by Abſolution, and receive the Sacrament upon it for confirmation of it, they make no queſtion but they ſhall go bolt right up to Heaven; and whatever their lives be, Death will be their gain without all peradventure. But
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:56446:298"/> Friend, be not too haſty to reckon without your Hoſt, ſit down a little, and think ſeriouſly of theſe Scriptures. <hi>Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe profiteth little,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 8. <hi>It is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that quickneth,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh profiteth nothing,</hi> John 6. 63. Circumciſion verily <hi>profiteth, if thou keep the Law; but if thou beeſt a breaker of the Law, thy Circumciſion is made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion,</hi> Rom. 2. 25. It's not the bare having them, but profiting by them in one ſenſe, if either in Life or Death thou wouldſt be profited by them in another. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we read <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 1, 2. <hi>What advantage hath the Jew, or what profit is there of Circumciſion? Much every way, and chiefly, becauſe unto them were committed the Oracles of God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul;</hi> and ſo ſay I, <hi>great</hi> is the <hi>gain</hi> that in Life and Death we get by them, if we in Life gain <hi>ſaving-Grace,</hi> and Souls-advantage by them: but they will not be ſo if we live wickedly, or but unfruitfully under them, and ſo have our condemnation aggravated by them, as ſome would gather out of <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. thoſe that will not be gathered in <note place="margin">Grotius.</note> the Goſpel's <hi>Harveſt. v.</hi> 15, 16. will be preſſed in the <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> of God's Judgments, <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18.</p>
            <p>4. Nor will outward Profeſſion, and a fair ſhew under thoſe Ordinances, which too many reſt in, and hope to gain Heaven by, accrue to their advantage at Death, and their laſt account then. <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay, <hi>Though I ſpeak with the Tongues of Men and Angels, and though I have the gift of Propheſy, and Faith to remove Mountains, and beſtow all my goods on the Poor, and have not true Charity, it profiteth me nothing,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>And more near to my purpoſe; that's a ſad queſtion, Job. 27. 8. <hi>What is the hope of the Hypocrite though he hath gained</hi> this and that, and the repute with Men, with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of more than ordinary proficiency in Grace and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>when God takes away his Soul?</hi> Man, thou wilt then be ſtript (for we ſhall all be judged) naked, and then, as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſaith in another caſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 8. <hi>The Morſel thou haſt eaten ſhalt thou vomit up,</hi> and <hi>loſe thy ſweet words:</hi> the hid cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of thy Heart will then up and out, to the loathing of both thy ſelf and others: and all thoſe <hi>ſweet words</hi> and pretences by which thou didſt impoſe upon others, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouredſt upon God alſo, will be all loſt, and thou with them, when thou ſhalt find that of the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 28, 29.
